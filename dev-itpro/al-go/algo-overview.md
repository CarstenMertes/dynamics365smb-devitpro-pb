# Overview of AL-Go

AL-Go for GitHub contains a comprehensive set of GitHub templates and actions designed to streamline and automate the setup and maintenance of professional DevOps processes for your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] AL projects. These templates and actions provide predefined workflows and configurations that help you manage your development lifecycle more efficiently. This includes tasks such as continuous integration (CI), continuous deployment (CD), automated testing, and version control. By leveraging AL-Go for GitHub, you can ensure that your AL projects follow best practices and maintain high standards of quality and reliability throughout the development process.

With AL-Go for GitHub, the goal is that people who have created their GitHub repositories based on the AL-Go templates can maintain these repositories and stay current just by running a workflow that updates their repositories. This maintenance includes necessary changes to scripts and workflows to cope with new features and functions in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)]. This way, developers can focus more on coding and less on managing the infrastructure, ensuring their projects are always up-to-date with the latest advancements and improvements.

The template repositories to use as starting point are:

- To create a **per-tenant extension**, here's your starting point
**[https://github.com/microsoft/AL-Go-PTE](https://github.com/microsoft/AL-Go-PTE)** is the GitHub repository template for per-tenant extensions.
- To create an **AppSource app**, here's your starting point
**[https://github.com/microsoft/AL-Go-AppSource](https://github.com/microsoft/AL-Go-AppSource)** is the GitHub repository template for AppSource apps. 

To get started with AL-Go, try out the [AL-Go for GitHub Workshop](https://github.com/microsoft/AL-Go/blob/main/Workshop/Index.md). All documentation for AL-Go for GitHub is maintained and updated in the repository. Go to [AL-Go for GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/AL-Go/blob/main/README.md) to see the latest documentation.
