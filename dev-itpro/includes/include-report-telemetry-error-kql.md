This KQL code can help you get started analyzing report failures:

```kql
traces
| where timestamp > ago(60d) // adjust as needed
| where operation_Name == "Failed report generation" // Note that in a later version of the schema, this field will not be used 
  or customDimensions.eventId == 'RT0006'            // introduced in version 16.1
| where customDimensions.result <> "Success"
| project timestamp
// in which environment/company did it happen
