> [!IMPORTANT]
> 25.2 includes database schema changes with the following consequences:
>
> - New platform version 25.2 instead of 25.0.
> - Different installation path than 25.0 and 25.1. Instead of using folder '250', components are installed in folder '252', for example: `C:\Program Files\Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central\252`.
> - Platform-only upgrade isn't supported. You must do a full platform and application upgrade.
>
> Future updates like 25.3 and 25.4 will also use platform number 25.2 and installation folder '252'.
