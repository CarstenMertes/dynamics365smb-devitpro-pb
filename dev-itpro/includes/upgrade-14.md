> [!NOTE]
> If you're coming from version 13 or earlier, Business Central Spring 2019 (v14) is a required step to upgrade to the latest version of Business Central. However, mainstream support for version 14 ends in October 2023, and minor updates to the version are no longer available. New customers can't use version 14 in production, but only as a path for upgrading to latest version. Existing customers on version 14 remain supported by Microsoft as defined in the [Fixed Lifecycle Policy](/lifecycle/products/dynamics-365-business-central-onpremises-fixed-policy).
