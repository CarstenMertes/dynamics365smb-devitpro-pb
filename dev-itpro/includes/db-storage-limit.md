By default, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](prod_short.md)] customers can use up to 80 GB plus an allowance per licensed Essentials or Premium user of database storage capacity. This storage capacity is shared, meaning that the sum of capacity usage across all environments in a tenant must not exceed the limit. If a tenant exceeds this limit, Microsoft restricts administrative actions that create additional environments. Exceeding the storage limit will not interrupt transaction processing within the existing environments.
