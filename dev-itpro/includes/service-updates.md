[!INCLUDE [prod_short](prod_short.md)] online is a service that consists of a Microsoft-maintained platform and business functionality. Many Microsoft partners provide extra business functionality, such as to address specific industry or localization needs. Both business functionality and service components are monitored continuously and updated as appropriate.  

New capabilities roll out in release waves that consist of a major update and monthly minor updates. Most capabilities are made available in major updates, but some become available in minor updates. Critical fixes roll out as soon as possible after they pass tests and have been verified in Microsoft's protected staging environment. You can always refer to the [release plan](/dynamics365/release-plans/) for an overview of new and upcoming functionality. To learn about new functionality, bug fixes, and improvements in recent versions, see [What's new or changed](../whatsnew/overview.md).  

> [!TIP]
> All updates that Microsoft applies to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](prod_short.md)] online are also shipped with the subsequent cumulative update for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](prod_short.md)] on-premises. For example, see [Update 24.5 for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central online 2024 release wave 1](../whatsnew/whatsnew-update-24-5.md) and [Dynamics 365 Business Central On-Premises 2024 Release Wave 1 Updates](../deployment/update-versions-24.md), respectively.
