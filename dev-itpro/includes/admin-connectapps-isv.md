If you are an ISV and want your banking app to show up in the **Connectivity Apps** page, reach out to us at Microsoft. We're testing the suggested apps according to business and functional requirements. The list relies on AppSource and is intended to show the best apps in that business's country or region for core connectivity scenarios. Learn more at [Requirements for Connectivity Apps](../compliance/connectivity-apps-requirements.md).
