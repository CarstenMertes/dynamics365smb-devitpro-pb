Customers can choose to configure conditional access that may restrict delegated admin access further. For example, it's a best practice to set up a conditional access policy to [require multi-factor authentication](/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/howto-conditional-access-policy-admin-mfa) for admins, and to set up [terms of use policies](/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/terms-of-use). Learn more at [Microsoft Entra ID Conditional Access documentation](/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/).
