[!INCLUDE [prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] comes with many tools that can help you gather information about a given problem, identify the cause of the problem, and eventually implement a sustainable solution that does not introduce new issues. Use the tools provided in the Business Central client to gain insights on trends in application behavior, identify performance issues, database locks, and more. Use profiling combined with debugging in sandboxes, or snapshot debugging in production environments to pinpoint what causes a specific issue. And if you want to investigate and troubleshooting things after they happened, then use telemetry and the tools around that feature.

For more information, see [Troubleshooting overview](../developer/devenv-troubleshooting-overview.md).
