> [!IMPORTANT]
> Specifically for businesses who want to convert a 30-day trial company into their actual production company, the first user who signs into [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] after the license was applied to their tenant must be a user with this license assigned. This way, the 30-day trial ends, and any trial-related notifications disappear so that users can use [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] to do work.
>
> If an administrator is the first person to sign in after the license was applied to the tenant and to users, then the trial will continue until it expires.
