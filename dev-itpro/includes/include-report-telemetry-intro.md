Report telemetry gathers data about which reports are run on the environment. It provides information about whether the report succeeded, failed, or was canceled. For each report, it tells you how long it ran, how many SQL statements it executed, and how many rows it consumed.

You use this data to gather statistics on report usage, find failures in reports, or to help identify slow-running reports.
