> [!NOTE]  
> Support for the SOAP protocol is being deprecated in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](prod_short.md)] and will be removed in the future. Start planning to move your solutions to use either OData or APIs pages/queries. The article [Deprecated Features in the Platform - Clients, Server, and Database](../upgrade/deprecated-features-platform.md) will include a section of which release this will happen in when a timeline is available for the removal.
