Both as an internal admin and as a delegated admin, you can help users determine the cause of their problems in different ways before you have to escalate the issue to Microsoft Support. The starting point is the [!INCLUDE [prodadmincenter](../developer/includes/prodadmincenter.md)] where you can access telemetry for the tenant and check the status of already reported outages. For more information, see [Managing Production and Sandbox Environments in the Admin Center](../administration/tenant-admin-center-environments.md).  

The [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home?#/servicehealth) provides an overview of service health across Microsoft services. Select **Preferences** to receive service health email notifications about incidents across [!INCLUDE [prod_short](prod_short.md)], Microsoft 365, and other Microsoft services. For more information, see [How to check service health](/microsoft-365/enterprise/view-service-health?view=o365-worldwide&preserve-view=true#how-to-check-service-health). If you manage more than one tenant, see [View service health for all accounts](/microsoft-365/admin/multi-tenant/manage).  

As a partner, use the Partner Center to get an overview of service health for each customer. For more information, see [Check service health for a customer](/partner-center/check-service-health) in the Partner Center content. You can also [use APIs for automated service notifications for Azure Insights & Office 365 service communications](/partner-center/get-automated-service-notifications-with-our-apis).
