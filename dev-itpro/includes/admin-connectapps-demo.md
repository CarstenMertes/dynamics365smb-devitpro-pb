Starting in 2022 release wave 2, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] online environments can list one or more apps on the **Connectivity Apps** and **Banking Apps** pages. We recommend that the admin opens the **Connectivity Apps** page from the **Extension Management** page and allows the underlying extension to connect to its external service either once or always. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] then connects to AppSource to generate a short list of apps that are approved for that country or region. These particular apps can connect to external services, such as online banking.
