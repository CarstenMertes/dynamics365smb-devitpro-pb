> [!IMPORTANT]
> Outbound HTTP calls from apps/extensions are blocked by default and must be approved for each extension, otherwise instead of an external call, the system will display the following error message: *The request was blocked by the runtime to prevent accidental use of production services.*
> 
> To enable outbound HTTP calls, go to the **Extension Management** page in Business Central, and choose **Configure**. Then, on the **Extension Settings** page, make sure that **Allow HttpClient Requests** is selected. This setting must be enabled for each app/extension, including library apps.
