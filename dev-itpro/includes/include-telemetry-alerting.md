If something happens in your environment or app that you need to act on, you can set up a system that sends you an alert. [!INCLUDE[appinsights](azure-appinsights-name.md)] makes it easy to define such alerts.

You can use the following tools to define and set up alerts on telemetry events:

- [!INCLUDE[appinsights](azure-appinsights-name.md)] Alerts
- Azure Logic Apps
- Power Automate

All three approaches need a Kusto (KQL) query to define the alerting condition.
