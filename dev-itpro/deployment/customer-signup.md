# Trials and sign-ups for Business Central online

As a reselling partner, you can invite customers and prospects to sign up for any number of Dynamics 365 apps, including [!include[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] online and partner solutions based on [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)], using the same account ID. These apps run side-by-side with each other, use different URLs, and display as separate tiles on the *home.dynamics.com* portal.  

This means that you can show prospects a preview of what you are offering based on trials of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] and other Dynamics 365 apps.  

Adjust the onboarding checklist to fit your solution, and provide in-app tours for key experiences. For more information, see [Onboarding experiences in Business Central](../administration/onboarding-experiences.md).

## Prospects and trials

Prospects can contact you if they sign up for the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] [free trial](/dynamics365/business-central/across-preview). This means that you can become their CSP partner. For more information, see [Connect with customers](../administration/get-started-online.md#connect-with-customers).  

Alternatively, you can create a more tailored trial environment based on the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] content pack on the [cdx.transform.microsoft.com](https://cdx.transform.microsoft.com/) site. For more information, see [Preparing Demonstration Environments of [!INCLUDE[prod_long](../developer/includes/prod_long.md)]](../administration/demo-environment.md).  

## Tailoring trials for customers using the public trial

As yet another alternative, partners can create customer centric trials via the public trial offered by Microsoft without the need for CSP in the initial phase, until the prospect wants to subscribe to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)]. These types of trials require more initial efforts from resellers in building these trial experiences as apps to be published to AppSource. The investment is justified by being able to pivot the trial experience by customer or segment type. For more information about these types of trials, see [Create customer-centric onboarding experiences](../administration/onboarding-signupcontext.md).  

[!INCLUDE [admin-trial-types](../includes/admin-trial-types.md)]

At any point during their trial experience, when they're ready, you can convert their trial to a paid subscription using the Partner Center dashboard. For more information, see [Converting trials to paid subscriptions](/partner-center/offer-your-customers-trials-of-microsoft-products#converting-trials-to-paid-subscriptions) in the Partner Center content.

## Prepare demo environments

As a Business Central reselling partner, you might want to have an environment that you can show prospects as part of pre-sales demonstrations. Depending on your requirements, you have several different options. For more information, see [Preparing Demonstration Environments](../administration/demo-environment.md).  

## Embed apps and signing customers up

Specifically for partners that are in the [!INCLUDE[embedapp](../developer/includes/embedapp.md)] program, signing up customers works differently. For more information, see [Onboarding customers and creating environments](embed-app-lifecycle-services.md#onboarding-customers-and-creating-environments).
