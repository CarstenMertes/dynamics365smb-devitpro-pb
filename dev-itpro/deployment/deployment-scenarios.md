# Deployment Topologies

[!INCLUDE[azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id](~/../shared-content/shared/azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id.md)]

A [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] deployment consists of various components that support the production, development, and testing. These components can be installed on various computers, in different combinations. The deployment process varies depending on the topology that you implement. This article provides an overview of the supported topologies.

## Deployment Scenarios 

The following table lists some of the most typical deployment topologies for the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)], with links to detailed instructions. However, components can be installed on one, two, or three machines in any combination. So your scenario might vary.

|Topology|[!INCLUDE[bp_tabledescription](../developer/includes/bp_tabledescription_md.md)]|More information|  
|--------------|---------------------------------------|---|  
|Demonstration|Installs an end-to-end environment, complete with the base application and demonstration data for a single company, on a single computer. The installation enables access to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] from the Web client and App, and development.<br /><br />The deployment requires minimal hardware resources, preparation, and configuration.| [Deploying a Demonstration Environment](deploy-demonstration-environment.md)|  
|Single-computer|Installs the [!INCLUDE[webserver](../developer/includes/webservercomponents.md)], [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)], and the SQL Server database components on the same computer.| [Deploying in a Single Computer Environment](deploy-single-computer-environment.md)| 
|Two-computer|Installs the [!INCLUDE[webservercomponents](../developer/includes/webservercomponents.md)] on one computer and the [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] and the SQL Server database components on another computer.|[Deploying in a Two Computer Environment](deploy-two-computer-environment.md)|  
|Three-computer|Installs the [!INCLUDE[webservercomponents](../developer/includes/webservercomponents.md)], [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)], and the SQL Server database components on separate computers.| [Deploying in a Three Computer Environment](deploy-three-computer-environment.md)|

> [!IMPORTANT]
> [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't support Microsoft Entra application Proxy, because Application Proxy doesn't fully support web sockets.
