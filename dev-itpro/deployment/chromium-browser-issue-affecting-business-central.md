# Chromium browser issue affecting Business Central

After the June 2022 wave of browser updates to Chromium-based browsers such as Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge, customers have experienced glitches in the Business Central user interface. While the teams behind the Chromium-based browsers work to address the root cause, Microsoft has prepared a fix to supported versions of Business Central. For Business Central online customers, the fix was applied to all Business Central deployments across all relevant regions between June 29 and July 4. The July cumulative updates for Business Central on-premises contain the same fix. This article describes how on-premises customers can identify the issue and plan their approach to fixing or working around the problem before their deployments are updated with the relevant July cumulative update.  

## How this issue affects your organization

Users impacted by this issue will experience misplaced UI elements in the Business Central user interface, such as the on/off switch control (for Boolean fields) or assist-edit control (on any field) being relocated to the upper corners of a page as illustrated in the following image. The misplaced controls may overlap each other, creating difficulties in identifying and activating the right one.

## What administrators can do to work around the issue

The following steps help all users in your organization work around the issue and vary depending on the version of Business Central you have deployed.

### Business Central version 13 and later

1. On your Web server, open the `desktopPreview.css` file in a text editor such as Notepad. The file is in your Web server instance folder, such as `C:\inetpub\wwwroot\InstanceName\wwwroot\Resources` where `InstanceName` is the identifier for your web server instance. The actual path depends on how you have configured IIS and the Business Central Web server.

2. Paste the following lines at the very end of the file, and then save your changes:

    ```css
    .ms-nav-edit-control-container,
    .booleancontrol-toggle-switch-container .edit-container .input-wrapper {
        transform: translateZ(0);
    }
    ```

3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 for the `tablet.css` and `phone.css` files that are in the same folder.

4. If your deployment has multiple Web server instances, repeat steps for 1 to 3 for each instance.

> [!NOTE]
> The changes come into effect immediately. No need to restart the service.

### Business Central versions 11 and 12

1. On your Web server, open the `desktop.css` file in a text editor such as Notepad. The file is in your Web server instance folder, such as `C:\inetpub\wwwroot\InstanceName\wwwroot\Resources` where `InstanceName` is the identifier for your web server instance. The actual path depends on how you have configured IIS and the Business Central Web server.

2. Paste the following lines at the very end of the file, and then save your changes:

    ```css
    .ms-nav-edit-control-container {
        transform: translateZ(0);
    }
    ```

3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 for the `tablet.css` and `phone.css` files that are in the same folder.

4. If your deployment has multiple Web server instances, repeat steps for 1 to 3 for each instance.

> [!NOTE]
> The changes come into effect immediately and no service restart is required.
