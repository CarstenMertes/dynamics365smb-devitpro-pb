# Components and capabilities

When you build an app for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)], be it an AppSource app or an [!INCLUDE[embedapp](../developer/includes/embedapp.md)], you must be aware of which components and deployment steps are provided by Microsoft and which you must provide.

## Components

### Base application

[!INCLUDE [admin-baseapp](../developer/includes/admin-baseapp.md)]

Microsoft recommends all partners to move towards a model where the code-customization of the base application isn't used. Keep track of new capabilities in the base application and platform in the [release plans](/dynamics365/release-plans/).  

### Platform

[!INCLUDE [msft-platform](../developer/includes/msft-platform.md)]

## Ecosystem

[!include[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] online is part of a rich ecosystem of other Microsoft and 3rd party services, which partners and customers can decide to take advantage of.  

The following integration capabilities of the [!include[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] can be considered:
