# Qualification and Onboarding of Partners to the [!INCLUDE[embedapp](../developer/includes/embedapp.md)] Program

If you as a software development partner are interested in developing an app that meets the description of [!INCLUDE[embedapp](../developer/includes/embedapp.md)] in [Embed App Overview](embed-app-overview.md), your app must meet qualification requirements. The main criteria for [!INCLUDE[embedapp](../developer/includes/embedapp.md)] onboarding at this point are:

- Partner must provide all day, every day support. Their customers do not get to call Microsoft support. They always call the partner.  
- Partner must live up to the standards for user assistance and documentation that are outlined in [[!INCLUDE[prod_long](../developer/includes/prod_long.md)] User Assistance Model](../user-assistance.md). Good user assistance is part of [!INCLUDE[embedapp](../developer/includes/embedapp.md)] success and uptake, and it also lowers the work load on their support center.  
- Partner is committed to stay on the supported platform.  
- Partner provides an SLA for requests from Microsoft towards the partner  
- Partners must have a support agreement with Microsoft  

Apps with a code-customized base application will have additional volume (number of users) requirements associated with it.  

When an [!INCLUDE[embedapp](../developer/includes/embedapp.md)] is qualified for onboarding to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] online, the partner must provide the following information about the [!INCLUDE[embedapp](../developer/includes/embedapp.md)] to the Microsoftâ€™s onboarding team:

- The name of the application to be used for the client and web service URL. For example, an ISV for the *fabrikamapples* app would provide the following information:

  - Client:  `https://fabrikamapples.bc.dynamics.com`  
  - Web Services:  `https://fabrikamapples.api.bc.dynamics.com`  

- Entitlements for their application objects, per license type. For more information, see [Licensing in Dynamics 365 Business Central](licensing.md).  

The rest of the information will be included with the [!INCLUDE[embedapp](../developer/includes/embedapp.md)] package that the partner deploys through LifeCycle Services.
