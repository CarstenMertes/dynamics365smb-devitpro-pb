# JSON Files

When you start a new AL project, two JSON files; the `app.json` file and the `launch.json` file are generated automatically. The `app.json` file contains information about the extension that you're building, such as publisher information and specifies the minimum version of base application objects that the extension is built on. Often, the `app.json` file is referred as the manifest. The `launch.json` file contains information about the server that the extension launches on.  

> [!NOTE]  
> For information about data migration and creating a `migration.json` file, see [The Migration.json File](devenv-migration-json-file.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The `rad.json` and the `snapshots.json` files should not be modified.

## <a name="Appjson"></a>App.json file

The following table describes the settings in the `app.json` file. To see an example `app.json` file, go to [Business Central Performance Toolkit](https://github.com/microsoft/ALAppExtensions/blob/main/Modules/DevTools/BusinessCentralPerformanceToolkit/app.json).

|Setting|Mandatory|Value|
|-------|---------|-----|
|id|Yes|The unique ID of the extension. When the `app.json` file is automatically created, the ID is set to a new GUID value. <br>**Note:** The app ID is used at runtime to bind table names contained in the application. Changing the app ID will result in data from old tables not being used.|
|name|Yes|The unique extension name. The name can be changed to reflect branding or acquisition, but then the `version` must be incremented. <br>**Note:** The name can be used by other extensions to express a compile-time dependency on the extension. Changing the name of your extension will force any extensions that have taken a dependency to download symbols and recompile their extension. For more information, see [App Identity](devenv-app-identity.md).|
|publisher|Yes|The name of your publisher, for example: **NAV Partner**, **LLC**. <br>**Note:** The publisher can be used by other extensions to express a compile-time dependency on the extension. Changing the publisher of your extension will force those extensions that have taken a dependency to download symbols and recompile their extension. For more information, see [App Identity](devenv-app-identity.md).|
|brief|No, but required for AppSource submission|Short description of the extension.|
|description|No, but required for AppSource submission|Longer description of the extension.|
|version|Yes|The version of the app package.|
|privacyStatement|No, but required for AppSource submission|URL to the privacy statement for the extension.|
|EULA|No, but required for AppSource submission|URL to the license terms for the extension.|
|help|No, but required for AppSource submission|URL to an online description of the extension focusing on the help and troubleshooting content. The link is used in AppSource and can be the same as the value of the `contextSensitiveHelpUrl` property. To learn more about *help links*, see [Help and Support Links](../developer/readiness/readiness-checklist-h-help-support.md).|
|url|No, but required for AppSource submission|URL of the extension package. The link is used in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], on the **Extension Management** page, as **Website**. This URL can be a link to an advertising page for your app, a page describing the features and additional resources other than troubleshooting and help, or it can be a link for contacting the app support, for example, see [Support Links](../developer/readiness/readiness-checklist-h-help-support.md#support-link).|
|logo|No, but required for AppSource submission|Relative path to the app package logo from the root of the package.|
|test|No|Version of the dependent test framework in the format X.Y.U.Z. <br>**Note:** This property is only supported for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] version 14 and earlier, where the base app is C/AL.|
|dependencies|No|List of dependencies for the extension package. For example: `"dependencies": [ {"id": "4805fd15-75a5-46a2-952f-39c1c4eab821", "name": "WeatherLibrary", "publisher": "Microsoft", "version": "1.0.0.0"},{}]`. <br>**Note:** For dependencies to the System Application and Base Application, these are no longer listed as explicit dependencies, but captured in the `application` setting as a reference to the application package. They must have a version number of the Application package. See `application` below. <br>**Note:** The version specified defines the minimum version for the dependency. At runtime and when downloading symbols, the latest version of the dependency satisfying the specified name, publisher and, minimum version will be returned. When `runtime` is set to 4.0 or earlier, use `appId` instead of `id`.|
|screenshots|No|Relative paths to any screenshots that should be in the extension package.|
|platform|Yes, if system tables are referenced in the extension|The minimum supported version of the platform symbol package file, for example: "16.0.0.0". See the [Symbols](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-get-started) for the list of object symbols contained in the platform symbol package file.|
|application|Yes, if base application is referenced in the extension. Required for AppSource submission|The supported version of the system and base application package file, for example: "16.0.0.0". The file name of this reference is Microsoft_Application.app and the `name` is `Application`. If the base application has been customized, the Microsoft_Application.app file can be modified to reference the code-customized base application instead. It's important to keep `"name": "Application"` in the extension, but information about publisher can be changed and the .app file can be renamed. For more information, see [The Microsoft_Application.app File](devenv-application-app-file.md).|
|idRange|Yes|A range for application object IDs. For example: `"idRange": {"from": 50100,"to": 50149}`. For all objects outside the range, a compilation error will be raised. When you create new objects, an ID is automatically suggested. To learn about which object ranges are allowed for your extension, see [Object Ranges](devenv-object-ranges.md).|
|idRanges|Yes|A list of ranges for application object IDs. For example: `"idRanges": [{"from": 50100,"to": 50200},{"from": 50202,"to": 50300}]`. For all objects outside the ranges, a compilation error will be raised. When you create new objects, an ID is automatically suggested. You must use *either* the `idRange` *or* the `idRanges` setting. Overlapping ranges aren't allowed and will result in a compilation error. To learn about which object ranges are allowed for your extension, see [Object Ranges](devenv-object-ranges.md).|
|showMyCode|No|By default, it's set to `false` and isn't visible in the manifest. To enable viewing the source code when debugging an extension, add the following setting: `"showMyCode": true`.<br> **Note:** This setting will be deprecated in a future release, and replaced by the `resourceExposurePolicy` setting introduced with runtime 8.0. It's described in this table.|
|target|No|By default, this is `Cloud`. The setting currently has the following options: `Internal`, `Extension`, `OnPrem`, and `Cloud`. The `Internal` and `Extension` settings are being deprecated with runtime 4.0 and replaced by the `OnPrem` and `Cloud` respectively. For on-premises, you can set this to `OnPrem` to get access to otherwise restricted APIs and .NET Interop. Then, the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Server setting must also be set to `OnPrem`. <br> **Note:** System tables that have the [Scope](properties/devenv-scope-property.md) property set to `Internal`/`OnPrem` can't be accessed from extensions that have `target` set to `Cloud`/`External` through direct reference or through RecordRef. For more information, see [Compilation Scope Overview](devenv-compilation-scope-overview.md)|
|contextSensitiveHelpUrl|No, but required for AppSource submission|The URL for the website that displays context-sensitive Help for the objects in the app, such as `https://mysite.com/documentation/`. If the app doesn't support all locales currently supported by [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], then include a parameter for the locale in this URL, `/{0}/`, and also specify the relevant locales in the `supportedLocales` setting.|
|helpBaseUrl|No|The URL for the website that overtakes all Help for the specified locales. This property is intended for localization apps specifically, since the setting overwrites the default URL of `/{0}/dynamics365/business-central`. If you set this value, you must also specify one or more languages in the `supportedLocales` setting.|
|supportedLocales|No|The list of locales that are supported in your Help if different from all locales. The value on the list is entered into the URL defined in the `contextSensitiveHelpUrl` and `helpBaseUrl` properties. The first locale on the list is default. An example is `"supportedLocales": ["da-DK", "en-US"]` for an app that supports only Danish and English (US).|
|runtime|No|The version of the runtime that the project is targeting. The project can be published to a server that supports the same or a higher runtime version. The available options are: <br>`1.0` - [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] April 2018 Release <br>`2.0` - [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Fall '18 Release <br>`3.0` - [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] Spring '19 Release <br> `4.0` - [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] 2019 release wave 2 <br> `5.0` - [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] 2020 release wave 1 <br>`6.0` - [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] 2020 release wave 2 <br>`6.1` - [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] 2020 release wave 2 update 17.1 <br> `6.2` - [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] 2020 release wave 2 update 17.2 <br> `6.3` - [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] 2020 release wave 2 update 17.3 <br> `6.4` - [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] 2020 release wave 2 update 17.4 <br> `7.0` - [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] 2021 release wave 1 <br> `7.1` - [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] 2021 release wave 1 update 18.1<br> `7.2` - [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] 2021 release wave 1 update 18.3<br> `8.0` - [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] 2021 release wave 2<br> `8.1` - [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] 2021 release wave 2 update 19.1 <br> `9.0` - [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] 2022 release wave 1<br> `9.1` - [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] 2022 release wave 1 update 20.1<br> `9.2` - [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] 2022 release wave 1 update 20.4<br>`10.0` - [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] 2022 release wave 2<br> For more information, see [Choosing Runtime Version in AL](devenv-choosing-runtime.md).|
|features|No|Specifies a list of options.<br><br> The `TranslationFile` option generates a `\Translations` folder that is populated with the .xlf file that contains all the labels, label properties, and report labels that you're using in the extension. The `GenerateCaptions` option depends on the `TranslationFile` setting. It generates captions for objects that don't have a `Caption` or `CaptionML` specified. These are then written to the .xlf file.<br><br> The `GenerateLockedTranslations` flag is used to generate `<trans-unit>` elements in the XLIFF file for locked labels. The syntax is `"features": [ "TranslationFile", "GenerateCaptions", "GenerateLockedTranslations" ]`. For more information, see [Working with Translation Files](devenv-work-with-translation-files.md).<br><br>When the `NoImplicitWith` flag is specified, `ImplicitWith` will be turned off by default. This flag is useful when all code has been rewritten to avoid any future use of `ImplicitWith`. For more information, see [Pragma ImplicitWith](directives/devenv-directive-pragma-implicitwith.md) and [Deprecating Explicit and Implicit With Statements](devenv-deprecating-with-statements-overview.md).|
|internalsVisibleTo|No|Specifies a list of modules that have access to the objects that are marked as `Internal` using the **Access** property from the current module.<br> The syntax is `{   "appId": "d6c3f231-08d3-4681-996f-261c06500e1a", "name": "TheConsumer", "publisher": "Microsoft"}]`. For more information, see [Access Property](properties/devenv-access-property.md) and [InternalEvent Attribute](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/attributes/devenv-internalevent-attribute).<br> **Note:** Using `internalsVisibleTo` in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online will throw a warning from AppSourceCop and PTECop. `Access = Internal` is *not* designed as a security boundary, but for API development.|
|propagateDependencies|No|Specifies whether the direct dependencies of this project should be propagated as direct dependencies of projects that depend on this one. Default is `false`. If, set to `true` then, any dependencies of the current package will be visible to consumers of the package. For example, if A depends on B that depends on C, by default, A won't be able to use types defined in C. If B has `"propagateDependencies" : "true"`, then A will be able to use types defined in C without taking a direct dependency.<br>**Note:** `propagateDependencies` applies to all direct dependencies, there's no option to exclude specific dependencies.|
|preprocessorSymbols|No|Defines any symbols to use with preprocessor directives. The syntax is `"preprocessorSymbols": [ "DEBUG","PROD" ]`. For more information, see [Preprocessor Directives in AL](directives/devenv-directives-in-al.md).|
|applicationInsightsKey|No, is deprecated in favor of `applicationInsightsConnectionString` as of runtime `7.2` - [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] 2021 release wave 1 update 18.2|The instrumentation key of the Azure Application Insights resource for monitoring operations, for example, like app secrets retrieval by extensions. <br><br>For more information, see [Monitoring and Analyzing Telemetry](../administration/telemetry-overview.md).|
|applicationInsightsConnectionString|No, but recommended for AppSource submission|The instrumentation key of the Azure Application Insights resource for monitoring operations, for example, like app secrets retrieval by extensions. <br><br>For more information, see [Monitoring and Analyzing Telemetry](../administration/telemetry-overview.md).|
|keyVaultUrls|No|List of URLs of key vaults that from which the extension can retrieve secrets. For example: `"keyVaultUrls": [ "https://myfirstkeyvault.vault.azure.net", "https://mysecondkeyvault.vault.azure.net" ]`. <br><br>For more information, see [App Key Vaults](devenv-app-key-vault-overview.md).|
|suppressWarnings|No|Specifies that warnings issued by, for example, a specific analyzer rule shouldn't be shown in the **Output** window. Syntax is `"suppressWarnings": [<warning ID>,<warning ID2>,...]`. For example, `"suppressWarnings": [ "AL0458" ]`. It's also possible to use `#pragma` directives for suppressing warnings for specific areas of code. For more information, see [Pragma Warning Directive](directives/devenv-directive-pragma-warning.md) and [Suppressing Warnings](devenv-deprecating-with-statements-overview.md#suppressing-warnings).|
|resourceExposurePolicy|No|Defines the accessibility of the resources and source code during different operations. The `resourceExposurePolicy` property contains four options for defining access: `applyToDevExtension`, `allowDebugging`, `allowDownloadingSource`, and `includeSourceInSymbolFile`. All defaults are false. The syntax is `"resourceExposurePolicy": {"applyToDevExtension": true, "allowDebugging": true, "allowDownloadingSource": true, "includeSourceInSymbolFile": true}`. For more information, see [Resource Exposure Policy Setting](devenv-security-settings-and-ip-protection.md).|

## <a name="Launchjson"></a>Launch.json file

The options are:<br> `WebserviceClient` - web API-based client including ODdata and SOAP clients, <br>`WebClient` - standard web client,<br> `Background` - background sessions, such as job queues, see [Task Scheduler](devenv-task-scheduler.md). <br><br>This setting applies to [Attach and Debug Next](devenv-attach-debug-next.md) and to [Snapshot Debugging](devenv-snapshot-debugging.md).<br><br> For *Attach* debugging, `breakOnNext` defines the next client session that the debug engine will attach to for the same user who has initiated an attach debug session from Visual Studio Code.<br><br>For *Snapshot* debugging, `breakOnNext` defines the next session to hook AL code execution recording for a given user on a tenant. Or, if this isn't specified with the userId in the configuration settings; the first user on the tenant.|
|breakOnRecordWrite | No |Specifies if and how the debugger breaks on record changes. With [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] 2022 release wave 2 `breakOnRecordWrite` contains the following options: `true`, `false`, `None`, `All`, and `Exclude Temporary`. <br> - `false`/`None` specifies to not break on any record writes.<br>- `true`/`All` specifies to break on all record writes.<br>- `ExcludeTemporary` specifies to break on record writes only if they are not on a temporary table.<br><br>The values `true` and `false` are retained for backward compatibility, mapping to `All` and `None`. It's recommended using the latter going forward. `True` and `false` might become obsolete in a future version.|

|disableHttpRequestTimeout|No|Specifies if the default setting for HTTP request timeout in Visual Studio Code is switched off. The default value is `false`. If the value is set to `true` requests can run without timeout.|
|attach| No| Sets the session to attach to. There are two options; `Attach to the next client on the cloud sandbox` and `Attach to the next client on your server`. Use the first option to attach to a cloud session, and the second option to attach to a local server. For more information, see [Attach and Debug Next](devenv-attach-debug-next.md).|
|forceUpgrade|No| Always run upgrade codeunits, even if the version number of the extension is the same as an already installed version. This can be useful for troubleshooting upgrade issues. <br><br>**Note:** The `forceUpgrade` setting requires the package ID to be changed.|
|useSystemSession|No|Runs install and upgrade codeunits in a system session. This will prevent debugging install and upgrade codeunits.|
|snapshotFileName|No|Specifies the snapshot file name used when snapshot debugging files are saved. For more information, see [Snapshot Debugging](devenv-snapshot-debugging.md).|
|primaryTenantDomain|No|Specifies the URL of the Azure AD organization or company associated with the Azure AD tenant. This setting enables AAD scenarios for on-premises installations. For more information, see [Azure AD authentication for Business Central on-premises
