# LocationOptions overview
When implementing location from AL, there are some options that you can optionally pass to `LocationProvider.RequestLocationAsync(options)`. The options can be accessed by using `Microsoft.Dynamics.Nav.Client.Capabilities.LocationOptions` found in the `Microsoft.Dynamics.Nav.ClientExtensions` dll.  

 For most scenarios it is not necessary to specify options.  

## LocationOptions list  

`bool EnableHighAccuracy`

A value to provide a hint to the device that this request must have the best possible location accuracy.

`int Timeout`

The maximum length of time \(milliseconds\) that is allowed to pass to a location request.

`int MaximumAge`
The maximum length of time \(milliseconds\) of a cached location.
