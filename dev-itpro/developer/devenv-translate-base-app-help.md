# Configure Localization App Location of Translated Base App Help

AL extensions that are approved localization apps can override the default help link for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and re-direct users that looks for content for Microsoft's base app in a non-Microsoft delivered translations.  

> [!NOTE]  
> This feature is not available for per-tenant extensions, and any usage will be caught by the [PerTenantExtensionCop Analyzer](./analyzers/pertenantextensioncop.md).

## Configure app.json properties

In the `app.json` file, two properties control the Help URL and the supported locale of the Help. Learn more at [Localization apps](../help/context-sensitive-help.md#localization-apps) and [JSON Files](devenv-json-files.md).
