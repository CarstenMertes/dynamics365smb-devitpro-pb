# Common Promoted Action Groups

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] defines the following common action groups as part of the standard application functionality. The list isn't exhaustive, but shows the most common action groups, their typical use, and the recommended use of the split button capability.  


| Common action group | Characteristics | Show as Split Button  |
|---------------------|-----------------|-----------------------|
|Home, or Process | This group has the caption Home in entity-oriented pages (Card, Document, ListPlus) and the caption Process in collection-oriented pages (Worksheet and List). In both cases, the group holds actions that change or update the current entity/entities. This group should have actions that start or end tasks, as the user sees it. | No |
|\<Name of an entity\> <br>For example Customer and Order | The caption of the Entity group in page matches that of the business entity represented by the page. For example, on the Customer Card page, the entity group has the caption Customer. Actions in an entity group let the user access information related to the entity on display in the page, and usually has a caption describing the type of information, for example Statistics.  | No | 
| Approve | Has actions to approve, reject, delegate, and view comments.<br> Used in these page types: Document (13), List (3) | No |
