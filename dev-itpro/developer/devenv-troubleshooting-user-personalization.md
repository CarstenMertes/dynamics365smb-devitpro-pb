# Troubleshooting user personalization can't be started

When there are issues preventing the user personalization in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the user will get an error message, and not be able to start user personalization.

## Symptoms

The user sees the following error message "Sorry, something went wrong and personalization could not be started. Please try again later, or contact your system administrator."

## Resolution

As a tenant administrator, you can do the following to mitigate the issue. 

> [!NOTE]  
> The following steps will delete records with compilation errors and the specific user personalizations will be deleted. It's recommended to take a screenshot of any personalizations done, before deleting them.

1. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], in the **Tell Me** box, enter **Personalized Pages**, and then choose the related link.
2. On the **Personalized Pages** page, use the filter pane to show records that belong to the impacted user.
3. Select the **Troubleshoot** button.  
  You'll now get a list of all records that contain errors. These records must be removed to unblock the user from starting user personalization.  
4. Select the **Manage** action to delete the user personalizations with errors.
