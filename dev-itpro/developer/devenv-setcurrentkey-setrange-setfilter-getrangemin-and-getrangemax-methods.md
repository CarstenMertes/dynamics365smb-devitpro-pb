# Filtering records with the SetRange, SetFilter, GetRangeMin, and GetRangeMax methods

The following methods can be used to filter records in a table:  

- SetRange  

- SetFilter  

- GetRangeMin  

- GetRangeMax  

 These methods are some of the most commonly used AL methods. They set limits on the value of one or more specified fields, so that only a subset of the records are displayed, modified, deleted, and so on.  


## SetRange Method  
 SetRange sets a simple filter on a field.  

 SetRange has the following syntax.  

```AL
Record.SetRange(Field [,From-Value] [,To-Value]);  
```  

 In the following example, SetRange filters the **Customer** table by selecting only those records where the **No.** field has a value between 10000 and 90000.  

```AL
Customer.SetRange("No.",'10000','90000');  
```  

 When you use SetRange the following rules apply:  

-   SetRange removes any filters that were set previously and replaces them with the *From-Value* and *To-Value* parameters that you specify.  

-   If you use SetRange without setting the *From-Value* and *To-Value* parameters, the method removes any filters that are already set.  

-   If you only set the *From-Value*, the *To-Value* is set to the same value as the *From-Value*.  

## SetFilter Method  
 SetFilter sets a filter in a more general way than SetRange.  

 SetFilter has the following syntax.  

```AL
Record.SetFilter(Field, String [, Value], ...]);  
```  

 *Field* is the name of the field on which you want to set a filter. *String* is the filter expression. *String* may contain placeholders, such as %1 and %2, to indicate where to insert the *Value* parameter\(s\) in a filter expression.  

 The following example selects records where the value of No. is larger than 10000 and not equal to 20000.  

```AL
Customer.SetFilter("No.", '>10000 & <> 20000');  
```  

 If the variables *Value1* and *Value2* have been assigned "10000" and "20000" respectively, then you can use the following statement to create the same filter.  

```AL 
Customer.SetFilter("No.",'>%1&<>%2',Value1, Value2);  
```  

## GetRangeMin Method  
 GetRangeMin retrieves the minimum value of the filter range that is currently applied to a field.  

 GetRangeMin has the following syntax.  

```AL
Record.GetRangeMin(Field);  
```  

 A run-time error occurs if the filter that is currently applied is not a range. For example, you can set a filter as follows.  

```AL
Customer.SetFilter("No.",'10000|20000|30000');  
```  

 With this filter, the following code fails because the filter is not a range.  

```AL
BottomValue := Customer.GetRangeMin("No.");  
```  

## GetRangeMax Method  
 GetRangeMax retrieves the maximum value of the filter range that is currently applied to a field.  

 GetRangeMax has the following syntax.  

```AL
Value := Record.GetRangeMax(Field)  
```
