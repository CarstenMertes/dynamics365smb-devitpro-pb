# Adding barcode scanning to the mobile app

> **APPLIES TO:** Business Central 2023 release wave 2 (version 23.0) and later; Business Central mobile app [version 4.0 or later](https://aka.ms/bcmobileapp).

Business Central offers native barcode scanning support in the mobile app and AL language, enabling developers to provide barcode scanning capability to users of the mobile app. Barcode scanning works on supported phones and tablets, either using the device's camera or a dedicated Android barcode scanner device.

## Supported scenarios

There are three different supported scenarios for adding barcode scanning to the mobile. The scenarios have varying levels of complexity. The approach you choose depends design needs, the scanner, and the device's operating system. The following table provides an overview. 

|Scenario|Description|Device camera| Dedicated scanner|iOS device|Android device|Online|On-premises|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|UI button on a field|The user scans a barcode by manually selecting a button next to a field|![Shows a checkbox indicating support](media/check.png)||![Shows a checkbox indicating support](media/check.png)|![Shows a checkbox indicating support](media/check.png)|![Shows a checkbox indicating support](media/check.png)|![Shows a checkbox indicating support](media/check.png)|
|Invoke from AL|Based on AL code, the barcode scanning capability is started when something happens, for example, a page opens, or the user selects a custom action on the page. |![Shows a checkbox indicating support](media/check.png)||![Shows a checkbox indicating support](media/check.png)|![Shows a checkbox indicating support](media/check.png)||![Shows a checkbox indicating support](media/check.png)|
|Integrate dedicated barcode scanner|Enable the use of professional hardware scanners.||![Shows a checkbox indicating support](media/check.png)||![Shows a checkbox indicating support](media/check.png)||![Shows a checkbox indicating support](media/check.png)|

## Supported barcodes

The barcode scanning capability supports several of the most common 1D and 2D barcode formats, including:​

- QR code​
- Data Matrix​
- UPC A​
- UPC E​
- EAN 8​
- EAN 13​
- Code 39​
- Code 93​
- Code 128​
- Codabar​*
- ITF​
- RSS14​*
- RSS Expanded​*
- PDF 417​
- AZTEC​

\* Not supported on iOS devices

## Requirements

- The field used for storing scanned barcodes is either [text](methods-auto/text/text-data-type) and [code](methods-auto/code/code-data-type) data type, which are the only two data types that support barcode scanning.
- Mobile device is using Business Central mobile app version 4.0 or later. To download the latest version, go to [https://aka.ms/bcmobileapp](https://aka.ms/bcmobileapp).
- Dedicated barcode scanners must be running Android 11 or later. 

## Scenario 1: Add a barcode scanning UI button on a field

The simplest way to provide barcode scanning capability in the mobile app is by adding a barcode scanning button on a field that starts the barcode scanner capability of the device's camera. 

![Shows the barcode scanning button an an item card](media/barcode-scanning-button.png)

This scanning is highly efficient and responsive. Once a barcode is scanned, its value is entered in the field on the page, and the focus moves to the next quick-entry field on the page. 


To enable the barcode scanning button on a field, set the [ExtendedDatatype](properties/devenv-extendeddatatype-property.md) property to `Barcode`. You can set ExtendedDatatype on either the field in the table or page. The property instructs  the mobile client to display the barcode button when the page is opened on a supported device.

The following code shows an example that adds a field with a barcode scanning button to the **Item** card page.


```al
pageextension 50101 ItemBarcode extends "Item Card"
{
    layout
    {
        addlast(Item)
        {
            field("Barcode"; Rec.GTIN)
            {
                Caption = 'Barcode';
                ExtendedDatatype = Barcode;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Scenario 2: Invoke barcode scanning programmatically from AL

With this scenario, you add logic in AL to start the barcode scanning UI when a certain operation occurs or conditions are met. For example, barcode scanning can start when a user selects an action or link. Or, when some semi-automated logic or trigger is invoked (for instance, when a page opens). This scenario uses the same camera-based scanning technology as scenario 1 and returns the scanned barcode value to AL code for further processing.

The basic steps for implementing this scenario are: 

1. Define the barcode scanner provider by declaring a `DotNet` variable `Microsoft.Dynamics.Nav.Client.Capabilities.CameraBarcodeScannerProvider`.
1. Verify the barcode scanner provider exists in context of the client. For example, if the user is working in the Business Central web client, this step returns false.  
1. Create the barcode scanner. For example, this step could inside a page action.
1. Call the camera action on the device.
1. Depending on whether the barcode is scanned successfully, call either the `BarcodeAvailable` or `BarcodeFailure` triggers.
   
This following code shows an example of how to start the barcode scanning when a page opens.


> [!TIP]
> For a detailed implementation as used in the Business Central base application, refer to source code of the **Item Tracking Lines** page (ItemTrackingLines.Page.al).

```al
page 50100 "MyALPage"
{
    Caption = 'MyPage';
    PageType = List;
    ApplicationArea = All;
    UsageCategory = Lists;

    layout
    {
        area(content)
        {
        }
    }

    var
        [RunOnClient]
        [WithEvents]
        CameraBarcodeScannerProvider: DotNet CameraBarcodeScannerProvider; // Step 1

    trigger OnOpenPage()
    begin
        if not CameraBarcodeScannerProvider.IsAvailable then begin // Step 2
            Message('Not available');
            exit;
        end;

        CameraBarcodeScannerProvider := CameraBarcodeScannerProvider.Create(); // Step 3
        CameraBarcodeScannerProvider.RequestBarcodeAsync(); // Step 4
    end;

    trigger CameraBarcodeScannerProvider::BarcodeAvailable(Barcode: Text; Format: Text) // Step 5
    begin
        Message(Barcode);
        exit;
    end;


    trigger CameraBarcodeScannerProvider::BarcodeFailure(failure: DotNet "CameraBarcodeScannerProviderFailure") // Step 5
    begin 
        if failure = failure.Cancel then
            Message('Cancelled');
        exit;

        if failure = failure.NoBarcode then
            Message('NoBarcode');
        exit;

        if failure = failure.Error then
            Message('Error');
        exit;
    end;
}
```

## Scenario 3: Integrate dedicated barcode scanners

This scenario enables the use of professional hardware barcode scanners, like Zebra or Datalogic, with the mobile app. The design is aimed at enhancing the efficiency of users, like warehouse employees, who need to scan many items in the span of a few seconds. While the user scans a series of items, the system processes the incoming barcodes. <!-- offering greater flexibility to developers.--> <!--It supports hardware barcode scanners, such as Zebra or Datalogic, that run on Android 11 and above. -->

A significant benefit of this scenario is that it allows for scanning barcodes and creating documents without the need for user interaction with the UI. When a barcode is scanned, the value is transmitted to the Business Central mobile app and then to the AL code. After AL intercepting an event from the Android device, AL code then processes the decoded barcode.


### Prepare barcode scanners 

For barcode scanners to communicate with the Business Central mobile app, they must be configured to emit Android Intent messages for every scanned barcode. By default, the mobile app is programmed to listen for certain types of messages from the barcode scanners. To enable this communication, you need to adjust the scanner's settings according to the values outlined in the following table:

|Scanner setting|Value|
|-|-|
|Intent delivery mode|broadcast intent|
|Intent action |com.businesscentral.barcode.receive_barcode|
|Intent category|com.businesscentral.barcode.receive_category|
|Intent barcode string|com.businesscentral.receive_barcode.barcode_string|
|Intent barcode type|com.businesscentral.receive_barcode.barcode_format|

Consult the manufacturer's guidelines for your specific scanner to learn how to modify these settings. For example, if you're using a Datalogic scanner, you can follow the instructions at [Configuring the Barcode Scanners on Datalogic Terminals To Work With TSL® Mobile Apps](https://www.tsl.com/configuring-datalogic-terminals-to-work-with-tsl-mobile-apps/).
<!-- 

AL developers need to explicitly instruct Business Central app to listen for incoming barcodes. 

the Business Central app listens to these events from the barcode scanner:

private static final String DEFAULT_INTENT_ACTION = "com.businesscentral.barcode.receive_barcode";

private static final String DEFAULT_INTENT_CATEGORY = "com.businesscentral.barcode.receive_category";

private static final String DEFAULT_DATA_STRING = "com.businesscentral.receive_barcode.barcode_string";

private static final String DEFAULT_DATA_FORMAT = "com.businesscentral.receive_barcode.barcode_format"-->


## Add barcode scanner functionality to the mobile app

In AL an extension, you add code that instructs the mobile app to listen for scanned barcodes. Barcode scanning is set up per page, which means that multiple barcode providers can be registered. However, incoming scanned barcodes are always sent to the current page open in the mobile app.​

The basic steps for implementing this scenario are: 

1. Specify the barcode scanner provider by declaring a `DotNet` variable for `Microsoft.Dynamics.Nav.Client.Capabilities.BarcodeScannerProvider`.
1. Verify the barcode scanner provider exists in context of the client using the `BarcodeScannerProvider.IsAvailable` method. For example, if the user is working in the Business Central web client, this step returns false.  
1. Create the barcode scanner using the `BarcodeScannerProvider.Create()` method. For example, this step could be called from a page action.
1. Instruct the app to listen for barcodes using the `BarcodeScannerProvider.RequestBarcodeScannerAsync()` method.

```al
page 50105 "BarcodeScannerReceiver"
{
    Caption = 'BarcodeScannerReceiver';
    PageType = List;
    ApplicationArea = All;

    layout
    {
        area(content)
        {
            group(General)
            {
                Caption = 'General';
            }
        }
    }

    var
        [RunOnClient]
        [WithEvents]
        BarcodeScannerProvider: DotNet BarcodeScannerProvider; //Step 1

    trigger OnOpenPage()
    begin
        if not BarcodeScannerProvider.IsAvailable then begin // Step 2
            Message('BarcodeScannerProvider Not Available');
            exit;
        end;

        BarcodeScannerProvider := BarcodeScannerProvider.Create(); // Step 3
        BarcodeScannerProvider.RequestBarcodeScannerAsync(); // Step 4
    end;

    trigger BarcodeScannerProvider::BarcodeReceived(Barcode: Text; Format: Text) // Result
    begin
        Message(Barcode);
        exit;
    end;

}
```
