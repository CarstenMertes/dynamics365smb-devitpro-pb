# Opening the Business Central Tablet or Phone Client from a Browser
You can open the [!INCLUDE[nav_tablet](includes/nav_tablet_md.md)] or the [!INCLUDE[nav_phone](includes/nav_phone_md.md)] by using a browser from a device that has a network connection. This can make it easier to test your solution during the design phase. <!--To be able to open the client in a browser you must know the name of the computer that is running the [!INCLUDE[nav_web_server](includes/nav_web_server_md.md)] and the HTTP port that it is running on.-->

The steps in this article illustrates how you can open the [!INCLUDE[nav_tablet](includes/nav_tablet_md.md)] in a browser. The syntax and options for opening [!INCLUDE[nav_phone](includes/nav_phone_md.md)] in a browser are the same; just replace *tablet* with *phone* in the examples later in this section.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Opening phone and tablet apps directly in the browser should only be used for testing. It isn't a supported production scenario.

## To open [!INCLUDE[nav_tablet](includes/nav_tablet_md.md)] in a browser  

1.  Open the web browser.  

2.  In the address box of the browser, type one of the following URLs.  

    |To open|URL|Example|  
    |-------------|---------|-------------|  
    |The Role Center for the default company<img width=25/>|*https://ComputerName:Port/WebServerInstance/tablet*<br /><br /> Or \(for multitenant deployments\)<br /><br /> *https://ComputerName:Port/WebServerInstance/tablet?tenant=TenantID*|https://MyBCWeb:8080/[!INCLUDE[serverinstance](includes/serverinstance.md)]/tablet|  
    |The Role Center for a specific company|*https://ComputerName:Port/WebServerInstance/tablet?company=CompanyName*<br /><br /> Or<br /><br /> *https://ComputerName:Port/WebServerInstance/tablet?tenant=TenantID&company=CompanyName*|https://MyBCWeb:8080/[!INCLUDE[serverinstance](includes/serverinstance.md)]/tablet?company=CRONUS%20International%20Ltd.|

     Substitute the following parameters:  

    -   **ComputerName** with the name of the computer that is running the [!INCLUDE[nav_web_server](includes/nav_web_server_md.md)].

    -   **CompanyName** with the name of the company in [!INCLUDE[d365_bus_cent_short](includes/d365_bus_cent_short_md.md)]. This parameter is optional and is only needed if you want to open a different company than the one specified in **My Settings**.
