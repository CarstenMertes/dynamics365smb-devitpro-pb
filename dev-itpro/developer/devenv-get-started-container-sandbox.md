# Get started with the container sandbox development environment

[!INCLUDE[d365fin_long_md](includes/d365fin_long_md.md)] offers a container-based image environment that enables access to the AL development environment. 

You set up a container sandbox by running the **Container Sandbox Environment** page from [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long_md](includes/d365fin_long_md.md)]. You have to decide whether you want an Azure-hosted or locally hosted container sandbox. See the next section for details.

> [!TIP]
> [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long_md](includes/d365fin_long_md.md)] also offers an online sandbox. For more information, see [Sandbox Environments for Dynamics 365 Business Central Development](devenv-sandbox-overview.md).

## <a name="AzureVsLocal"></a>Choosing an Azure-hosted or local-hosted container sandbox

When you set up the container sandbox, you can choose to host the sandbox on Microsoft Azure or on a local computer. Both environments offer the same capabilities and use Docker to provide the infrastructure for the container-based application. The difference is:

- With Azure hosting, Docker is installed and configured for you. However, Azure hosting requires that you sign up for an Azure subscription, and more costs might be incurred for each container sandbox.
- Local hosting requires that your computer is running Windows Desktop, Windows Server 2016, or Windows Server 2019, and you install and configure Docker before setting up the container sandbox.

## Set up an Azure-hosted container sandbox
1. If you don't already have one, sign up for an Azure subscription.

    To get a free subscription and read more information, see [https://azure.microsoft.com](https://azure.microsoft.com).

2. In [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long_md](includes/d365fin_long_md.md)], choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../media/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Container Sandbox Environment**, and then select the relevant link.
3. Choose **Host in Azure**. If prompted, enter the user name and password of your Azure subscription. 

    The Azure portal opens to display a custom deployment form. 
4. Fill out the required fields on the form, and then select **Purchase**.

> [!NOTE]  
> You must set the **Accept Eula** setting to **Yes** in order to continue.

## Set up a local-hosted container sandbox

### Prerequisite: install Docker

If not already done, install Docker.

To install and configure Docker, choose the version of Docker that is appropriate for the host operating system:

- For Windows Desktop, use [Docker Desktop on Windows](https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-windows). For more information, see [Install instructions](/virtualization/windowscontainers/quick-start/quick-start-windows-10).
- For Windows Server, use [Docker Enterprise Edition](https://hub.docker.com/editions/enterprise/docker-ee-server-windows). For more information, see [Install instructions](/virtualization/windowscontainers/quick-start/quick-start-windows-server).

### Set up a Docker container sandbox using BCContainerHelper

To set up a Docker container sandbox using an existing sandbox environment, see [Running a Container-Based Development Environment](devenv-running-container-development.md).

### Set up a Docker container sandbox using an existing sandbox environment

To set up a Docker container sandbox using an existing sandbox environment, follow these steps
2. In [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long_md](includes/d365fin_long_md.md)], choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../media/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **SANDBOX ENVIRONMENT (CONTAINER)**, and then select the relevant link.
3. Choose **Host Locally**.
4. Save the **CreateBCSandbox.ps1** file to your computer.
5. Run Windows PowerShell ISE as an administrator.
6. Open the **CreateBCSandbox.ps1** file.
7. Set the `$containername = ''` variable to the name that you want to give the container, for example `$containername = 'mybc'`.  
  This name is only used internally in your environment for identification purposes.
8. Set the `$accept_eula = ''` variable to `'$true'`.
9. Select <kbd>F5</kbd> to run the script.

    The console pane displays the progress of the script. When the script has completed successfully, information like in the following example displays:
    ```
    ...
    Container IP Address: 172.22.147.63
    Container Hostname  : mybc
    Container Dns Name  : mybc
    Web Client          : http://mybc/BC/
    Dev. Server         : http://mybc
    Dev. ServerInstance : BC

    Files:
    http://test:8080/ALLanguage.vsix

    Initialization took 116 seconds
    Ready for connections!
    Reading CustomSettings.config from mybc
    Creating Desktop Shortcuts for mybc
    ```

10. Write down or copy the following parameter/values from the console: `Dev. Server`,  `Dev. ServerInstance`, and `Files`. You need this information later to [set up Visual Studio Code for extension development](#VSCode).

You now have a container sandbox set up on your computer. The following shortcuts are added to your desktop:

- **\<Container name\> Web Client** - opens the [!INCLUDE[d365fin_web_md](includes/d365fin_web_md.md)] for your application in the container.
- **\<Container name\> PowerShell Prompt** - opens a Windows PowerShell prompt in the container. This gives you access to the [!INCLUDE[navnowg_md](includes/navnow_md.md)] (/powershell/business-central/overview), which you can run against the container sandbox environment. 
- **\<Container name\>Command Prompt**  - opens a Windows command prompt in the container.


### <a name="VSCode"></a>Set up Visual Studio Code

After the container sandbox is set up, you must set up Visual Studio Code for extension development. To do this, you need the values for `Dev. Server`,  `Dev. ServerInstance`, and `Files` parameters that you retrieved from the Windows PowerShell ISE console when you ran the **CreateBCSandbox.ps1** script. 

1. In Visual Studio Code, go to **Extensions**, and install the AL Language extension from the Marketplace.
    You now have the [!INCLUDE[d365al_ext_md](../includes/d365al_ext_md.md)] enabled.
2. In Visual Studio Code, select <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd> and then choose **AL Go!**.
3. Choose where to create the project, and then choose the **Your own server** option.
4. Open the generated `launch.json` file, update the `"server"` setting with the value of the `Dev. Server` parameter and the `"serverInstance"` setting with the value of the `Dev. ServerInstance` to reflect the container you created. For example:

    ```
    "server": "http://mybc",
    "serverInstance": "BC",
    "authentication": "Windows",
    ```
5. Save the launch.json file.

You have now set up Visual Studio Code with the [!INCLUDE[d365al_ext_md](../includes/d365al_ext_md.md)].
