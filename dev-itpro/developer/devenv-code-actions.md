# AL Code Actions

The [!INCLUDE[d365al_ext_md](../includes/d365al_ext_md.md)] can help users to fix issues in the code. **Code Actions** is a Visual Studio Code feature that provides the user with possible corrective actions right next to an error or warning. If actions are available, a light bulb appears next to the error or warning. When the user chooses the light bulb (or presses **Ctrl+.**), a list of available code actions is presented. A code action can be applied to a single instance or a broader scope depending on the type of action.

In [!INCLUDE[d365al_ext_md](../includes/d365al_ext_md.md)], these code actions are available in the current version:

- Multiple IF to CASE converting code action
- Spell check code action
- Interface implementer
- Make method local
- Use parenthesis for method call fix for instance, document, project, or workspace.
- Fix explicit `with` statements
- Fix implicit with statements
- Fix old report layout and replace with `rendering` layout section
- Fix for [AW0013](analyzers\uicop-aw0013.md)
- Convert pages or page extensions to use the `actionRef` syntax for promoted actions on the action bar. Fix for instance, document, project, or workspace. For more information, see [Code action for actions](devenv-code-actions.md#code-actions-for-promoted-actions).

## Code actions for promoted actions

Use the code action to convert *legacy* syntax for promoted actions to the `actionref` syntax, which is introduced with [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] 2022 release wave 2. In-client customizations, user personalization, and profile configurations are automatically converted into the new syntax, so this is primarily applicable to DEV extensions. The code action can apply to a single instance, the document, the project, or the workspace.

  > [!NOTE]  
  > For Designer extensions, use **F6** to open **Designer**, which opens the page where the legacy syntax is used. Choose the Lock symbol and use **Unlock page** to automatically convert the legacy syntax for the running code. Pressing **Alt+F6** will bring you back into Visual Studio Code, and show the converted `actionref` code.
  
  
## To enable AL Code Actions

1. Open the Command Palette by pressing **Ctrl+Shift+P** and then open the `settings.json` file.  
2. Enter the setting `al.enableCodeActions` and set it to `true` like this `"al.enableCodeActions": true`
3. Save the settings file. You have now enabled code actions on your project.

Alternatively:

1. Open the Settings Page, **Ctrl+,** and choose either **User Settings** or **Workspace Settings** depending on which scope you want the code actions to apply to.
2. Navigate to **Extensions > AL Language extension configuration**.
3. Choose the **Enable Code Actions** checkbox. You've now enabled code actions on your project.
