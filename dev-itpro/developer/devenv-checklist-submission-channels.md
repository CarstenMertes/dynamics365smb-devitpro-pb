# AppSource channels for questions and issues FAQ

This article addresses some of the most frequently asked questions around validation of apps for AppSource submission. In the following, you can read about how you reach out for support most efficiently.

## When do I contact d365val@microsoft.com?

When registering affixes for your publisher, or adding a new publisher name to your affixes. When contacting d365val@microsoft.com, make sure to provide the required information documented in [Benefits and Guidelines for using a Prefix or Suffix](../compliance/apptest-prefix-suffix.md).

## When do I contact Partner Center customer support?

When your submission fails to be successfully completed in Partner Center, but you're experiencing issues updating your extensions to fix the validation errors.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> If you're using Azure Application Insights, before opening a support case for a failure at the 'Automated application validation', you must analyze the [signals](../administration/telemetry-appsource-submission-validation-trace.md) emitted in your Azure Application Insights storage. You can do so by using the [Troubleshooting Guide (TSG)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2172328). When opening a support case, you must include the Kusto queries you used and the diagnostic messages that you found. Including the results from the TSG is also recommended.

## When do I contact Business Central customer support?

When your submission has been successfully completed in Partner Center, but your customers are experiencing issues installing or using the app.

## When do I log an issue on NavContainerHelper on GitHub?

When you have questions or bugs regarding the self-validation script, or any of the modules exposed by BcContainerHelper.

Learn more in [https://github.com/microsoft/navcontainerhelper/issues](https://github.com/microsoft/navcontainerhelper/issues).

## When do I write on Viva Engage?
