# Help and support links

## Help link

| Item | Description |
|-------------|--------------|
Help link | You need to provide a URL for a distinct help page where prospects can find different types of online product help. The help page needs to include online documentation that can be used as help. Your Help Link should be a landing page on your website where one can find help resources, such as documentation, FAQs, step-by-step guides, webinars, and so on.|
 
**About the help page:**

- The Help page can be in any language. 
- There needs to be a clear distinction between the support and the help site. We require two separate pages (unless a single page covers all Help Link and Support Link requirements). 

**What should I include on my help page?**

- You should include online documentation that can be used as help
- Examples are FAQs, step-by-step guides, instructions on how to get started, learn more documents, videos etc.)

For more information, see [Help users learn more](../../user-assistance.md#help-users-learn-more).
