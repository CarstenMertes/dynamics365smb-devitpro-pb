# Offer Description 
 Make an elaborate and compelling description that outlines the benefits and usage scenarios of your  offer.

> [!NOTE]  
> The description can be in multiple languages (max 3) but must be the same content for each language. If English is not one of the languages chosen, an English document must be added to the document section. 

## How to structure the paragraphs in your description?
Describe WHY customers would need your product and the value they get from using it instead of just writing WHAT your product does. To do so, your description should ideally consist of six paragraphs (in the following order):
- Introduction paragraph
- Pain based paragraph
- Benefit based paragraph
- Benefits in bullet points paragraph
- Closing Call to action paragraph
- Supported editions, countries/regions, and languages paragraph

By including all of these paragraphs, you'll provide prospects with a compelling offer that explains them WHY they need to start using it.

How to format your description in Partner Center? The right formatting enables prospects to get a quick overview of the value that your offer can give them. Making the description compelling and nice to look at is therefore of key importance. 

When formatting the description of your offer, consider the following guidelines:

- The description can max. be 3000 characters incl. spaces
- Use the Rich Text Editor when formatting your description to create structured sections that are easy to get an overview of. 
- Structure your description as small "easily readable" sections with headlines
- List vital benefits as bullet points
- Engage prospects by speaking directly to them using second person "you" language.

## How to structure your description text - step by step: 

| Paragraph| Description |
|-------------|--------------|
|Introduction paragraph | To capture (and keep) the interest of the prospects, you need to create interest and positive mental acknowledgment from the start. This can be achieved by asking relevant provocative questions that prospects either don't know the answer to or can relate to in the introduction paragraph |

How to structure the content in this paragraph?

- Make a section where you ask provocative questions. 
- Speak to a core pain they're likely experiencing that has a negative measurable effect
- The question should stimulate a strong emotional response.


> [!TIP]  
> *Example: Do you have the right stock on your shelves? Are stock outs costing your customers? And are your procurement decisions relying on basic spreadsheets?*


| Paragraph| Description |
|-------------|--------------|
|Pain paragraph | Pain is the most compelling motivator of driving prospects to take action. Therefore, it is of the upmost importance that you communicate WHY your prospects need your product through a "pain-based" paragraph that calls out the fears that they're facing. |

How to structure the content in this paragraph?

- Use this paragraph to clearly demonstrate to your prospects that you genuinely understand their industry and unique business problems.
- Describe the business challenges they're facing now (pain) and the ways their revenue growth, margins, productivity (desire), and so on, are being negatively impacted by not taking action now.
- Most importantly, call out the fears that are likely holding them back.
- Remind them of the cost (higher risk, lower margins, lost sales) they're experiencing by putting off a decision. In so doing, you have a bigger likelihood of getting the messages through to them and enticing them to take action.

> [!TIP]  
> *Example: Managing inventory is a delicate balancing act. Carry too little and you
lose orders (and customers). Carry too much and you tie up much needed working capital. Carry far too much and you end up discounting, or worse, writing off obsolete products.*

| Paragraph| Description |
|-------------|--------------|
|Benefit paragraph | Likewise, you should also make a paragraph that describes the most important benefits and rewards that your prospects will realize by using your offer. |


How to structure the content in this paragraph?

- Tell them what they'll gain by using your offer 
- You don't need to tell them how you do it, just what they'll gain.
- When describing the potential value in specific, measurable business terms, you'll appeal to both their desire and greed.

Quantify impacts and gains.

- The more specific and concrete your promise of value is, the better. Abstract concepts such as "more efficiency, more productivity, transform your business" aren't emotionally impactful or convincing, and they don't compel a prospect to act. Paint a picture of a possible experience that the prospect will immediately desire.
- Avoid the temptation of simply listing features and app functionality.
- If you make strong claims in the benefit paragraph, make sure you support them with proof.


> [!TIP]  
> *Example: Our app uses Cortana Intelligence to analyze historical data to predict
future demand, so you can base procurement decisions on accurate and
reliable forecasts, and help your company avoid lost revenue, optimize
shipping costs, discover trends and boost your brand reputation by always
delivering on orders.*
*Stop relying on basic spreadsheets that take hours of valuable time to
complete. Turn anxiety into proactive control and manage this critical
business process in minutes by using Microsoft's Sales and Inventory
Forecast extension.*


| Paragraph| Description |
|-------------|--------------|
|Benefits in bullet points paragraph | Highlight your offer's benefits by listing them as bullet points.  |


> [!TIP]  
>*Example*: *Features and benefits of using this extension: Free up cash, know exactly when to replenish stock, always have inventory on hand to satisfy every customer order*. 

| Paragraph| Description |
|-------------|--------------|
|'Closing call to action' paragraph | Round off your description with a strong 'Closing call to action' paragraph that urges customers to take action in order to realize your offer's benefits. |

Choose the type of Call to action that you want to include:
- Calls to actions are active directions to your offer's: Landing page, a link to a button at the storefront details and/or a "learn more" document
- We recommend that you link to both a button and your offer's unique app landing page in the closing call to action.
