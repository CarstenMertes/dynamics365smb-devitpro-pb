# Marketing validation FAQ
 
## Where do I state the countries/regions, editions and languages that my offer supports?  

You're required to state the countries/regions, editions and languages that your offer supports in the bottom of your offer’s description text. You can use the following format:  
**Supported Editions:**  
    The app supports the Essentials and Premium Editions of Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central.  
**Supported Countries/regions:**  
    Canada, Mexico and United States  
**Supported Languages:**
    This app is available in English (United States) and Spanish (Mexico). 
 
## Do you have any tips and tricks for what I should write in the description text?  

Yes. We have detailed guidelines and good advice about that [here](readiness-checklist-c-offer-description.md).  

## How do I refer correctly to the product?  

When you mention the product, both throughout your description text, and in your marketing material, you need to refer to the product, in the following way:  
 
**First mentions:** Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central  
 
**Secondary mentions:** Dynamics 365 Business Central  
 
**Subsequent mentions:** [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] 
 
Therefore, you can't use any abbreviations such as “MS Dyn 365 BC” or “Microsoft Dynamics NAV”. 
 
## What are the requirements for my offer’s help and support page?

You're required to submit two distinct pages for support and help that is, they cannot be the same. You can see what you have to include on both pages in the table below.  

|Help|Support|
|----|-------|
|Learning material such as FAQs, step by step guides, video tutorials, webinars etc.|At least two contact options (for example, e-mail, phone, chat) and a defined SLA for how much time it takes before you answer to support inquires.|

## Can I use the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central logo?  

No, you can't use the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] logo, as it’s a Microsoft trademarked logo. However, you can use the “Get it from Microsoft AppSource” badge, which you can find [here](https://appsource.microsoft.com/blogs/new-get-it-from-badging-for-microsoft-appsource-and-azure-marketplace-available-in-the-marketing-resources-guide). 

## Can we speed up or avoid Marketing validation?  

Marketing validation is a manual process that is required for new offers or when the marketing details change on existing offers. As a publisher there is no way you can impact how fast the marketing validation process takes. 

However, since marketing validation now only happens when marketing details are added or changed, you can ensure that you don't make such changes if it's important for you to get the submission through as quickly as possible, for example, when releasing a hotfix. Once that hotfix has passed the submit process and gone live, you can then submit a new version with required marketing details updated, and await the validation process.
