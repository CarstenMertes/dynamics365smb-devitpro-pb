# Marketing validation checklist

The storefront details on AppSource are the first impression that prospects get regarding your offer. First impressions last, so make sure to invest some time in developing the content on the storefront, so it gives a good impression from the beginning. Failing to do so will jeopardize the hard work you put in, when developing your offer, likely leaving the prospect confused or looking elsewhere. Accordingly, we recommend you put in the time, effort and due diligence when developing this content.

You use Partner Center to submit your offer to AppSource. In the following, you can find information on all the marketing-related items that you need to fill out in Partner Center prior to submitting your app to AppSource. Follow this marketing validation checklist and get your app passed on the first submission. 

> [!TIP]  
> Marketing validation is a manual process that is required for new offers or when the marketing details change on existing offers. As a publisher there is no way you can impact how fast the marketing validation process takes. 
> 
> However, since marketing validation now only happens when marketing details are added or changed, you can ensure that you don't make such changes if it's important for you to get the submission through as quickly as possible, for example, when releasing a hotfix. Once that hotfix has passed the submit process and gone live, you can then submit a new version with required marketing details updated, and then await the validation process.
