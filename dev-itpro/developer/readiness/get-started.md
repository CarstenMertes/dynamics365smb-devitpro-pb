# Get started with building apps

[!INCLUDE[azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id](~/../shared-content/shared/azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id.md)]

[!INCLUDE [prod_long](../includes/prod_long.md)] is a business management solution that helps companies connect their services and operations to streamline business processes, improve customer interactions and make better decisions. With this modern business platform, you have the convenience to quickly tailor, extend, and build applications so that they fit your specific needs with little to no code development.

Build a business app for a specific industry, process, or department such as HR, finance, marketing or operations. Then, publish your app to [the Microsoft commercial marketplace](https://appsource.microsoft.com/partners), where customers can find your app, try it and get in touch with you. For more information, see [What is the Microsoft commercial marketplace?](/azure/marketplace/overview).  

Learn how you can become a [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] app publisher in six steps in this article.  

## Step 1: Become a partner

When you become a Microsoft partner, you get access to the Microsoft resources needed to build, market, and sell your apps. You don't have to be a Microsoft partner to begin developing your apps. But, all of the steps below are required to gain access to the programs that enable you to publish, market, and sell your apps for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)].

### Obtain your work account

Your work account is the email address provided to you by your company. This email is usually in the format `you@yourcompany.com`. For more information on work accounts, see [Link your work Account](/partner-center/azure-active-directory-tenants-and-partner-center).

[!INCLUDE [admin-partner-mpn](../includes/admin-partner-mpn.md)]

## Step 2: Register as a publisher

The first step to becoming a publisher is to register in Partner Center (PC). PC is where you submit your apps for publication, promote them, and manage your offers. To begin the registration process, you must complete [these steps](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/account/v3/enrollment/introduction/azureisv). One of our team members follow up to help you complete your registration. Once registered, you can access PC.

For more information, see [Partner Center Account](/partner-center/partner-center-account-setup).  

### PartnerSource Business Center (PSBC) account

To develop apps for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)], you're required to be known as a [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] developer. You must also have a unique development license file with a specific object range.  

To obtain an object range for developing a [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] app, you must have access to PartnerSource Business Center (PSBC). Either of the following agreements gives you access to PSBC, which is a first step towards getting a development license:

- [Partner Registration Agreement (PRA)](https://businesscenter.mbs.microsoft.com/#contentdetail/MSDpartneragreem) (PRA)
- Solution Provider Agreement (SPA)<!--(https://businesscenter.mbs.microsoft.com/#contentdetail/RegisterSolutionProgram)-->

> [!NOTE]  
> We're no longer accepting new partner enrollments for the Solution Provider Agreement.

The relevant contract can be requested through your local Regional Operations Center (ROC) Contracts and Agreements Team below:

- [partnerlifecycle@microsoft.com](mailto:partnerlifecycle@microsoft.com) (for all regions).

## Step 3: Your unique app specifications

### Requesting an object range

When you develop an app for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)], you must request access to an object range that holds some objects for your solution. To avoid overlap between objects used in different solutions, each partner is assigned many objects in a unique object range. For example, a partner is assigned the object range 70,001,000 – 70,001,999. The object range gives them 1000 numbered objects that they can use to develop [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] solutions.

Depending on where you deploy your [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] solution, online or on-premises, you can use different licensing methods and object ranges.  

[!INCLUDE [object-ranges](../includes/object-ranges.md)]

You can request an object range by downloading the object range request form [here](https://businesscenter.mbs.microsoft.com/#contentdetail/RegisterSolutionProgram). After completion, send them to your Regional Operational Center (ROC) for processing:

- [mbsquery@microsoft.com](mailto:mbsquery@microsoft.com) if you're based in Europe, the Middle East, or Africa.
- [mbsorder@microsoft.com](mailto:mbsorder@microsoft.com) if you're based in the Americas.
- [mbslques@microsoft.com](mailto:mbslques@microsoft.com) if you're based in the Asia Pacific region.

### Downloading your development license file

After your Regional Operational Center process your Agreements and Object Range Request forms, download your company's unique developer license from [PartnerSource Business Center](https://aka.ms/PSBC). Find it in the license key configuration section under the developer tools section.

### Register your unique prefix or suffix

In your extension, the name of each object must contain [a prefix or suffix](../../compliance/apptest-prefix-suffix.md) that is registered for your publisher name. For more information about the use of affixes and the registration process, see [Benefits and Guidelines for using a Prefix or Suffix](../../compliance/apptest-prefix-suffix.md).
 
## Step 4: Getting access to preview bits

Get access to preview builds by joining Microsoft Collaborate.

In Microsoft Collaborate, you get access to a set of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] builds:

- The current major version
- An upcoming major version

You must have the following prerequisites to register on Microsoft Collaborate:

- Microsoft Entra ID.

  > [!NOTE]
  > If you have Microsoft 365, then your company most likely has Microsoft Entra ID.

- Microsoft Entra Global Administrator permission

  > [!NOTE]
  > To find out if your company has a Microsoft Entra account, check with your system administrator.

### Step 4 A: How your Global Administrator must register for Collaborate

Only your company's Global Administrator can start the onboarding to Collaborate. They must register at [https://aka.ms/Collaborate](https://aka.ms/Collaborate), choose the **Get Started** action, and then complete the registration form.  

The administrator can then add the relevant colleagues.

Contact [Dyn365BEP@microsoft.com](mailto:Dyn365BEP@microsoft.com) and provide them with information about the relevant users. the following table illustrates the type of information that you must submit:

| **Publisher Display Name** | **MPN ID** | **First Name** | **Last Name** | **Work account Email** |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| Contoso | 12345 | Eugenia | Lopez | Eugenia.Lopez@Contoso.com |
| Contoso | 12345 | Quincy | Watson | Quincy.Watson@Contoso.com |

After sending the email, expect a response from Microsoft within 1-2 business days.
