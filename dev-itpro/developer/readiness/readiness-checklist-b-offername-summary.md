# Offer name and offer summary


## Offer name

When creating a name for your offer, you can use the following two naming structures:

- Name 1: [Your offer name] for Dynamics 365 Business Central 

    *Example: QR Generator for Dynamics 365 Business Central*

- Name 2: Your offer name only 

    *Example: QR Generator*  

> [!NOTE]  
> The name of your app can not exceed 50 characters.

**How to create a strong app name for your offer**:

*Doâ€™s*
- Ideally, your app name should communicate the core value of the offer and it shouldn't be tied to a specific product 
- Benefit-based names are always more effective than descriptive names. 
- Use industry specific vocabulary or benefit-based references in your product name if possible, which will increase relevance and conversion rates.

*Don't*
- Don't use special characters such as #, /, % etc. 
- Don't use technology specific messaging as your core product name component.
- Avoid using acronyms that are emotionally meaningless.


**Key questions to ask yourself when choosing a name for your offer:**
- Does my product name convey anything to my prospect? 
- Does it capture the essence of the product and the value it delivers?
- Is it appropriate and appealing to our target audience? 
- Does the name connect with what our business is about?
- Is it interesting and memorable?
- Does it limit us in any way? How easily will it translate into other languages/cultures?
- Is it too much like another product and will it cause market confusion?


## Offer Summary
 The summary is the first paragraph that the prospect reads, as it appears on your app's search page. Therefore; make sure that it's clear and concise.

**How to create a good and concise summary?** 
- The summary should be max. 25 words or 100 characters including spaces.
- The summary should summarize the value proposition of your offer in one short and concise sentence.
- The value proposition is a statement of the unique benefits your product delivers to the customer. 
- The summary can be in any one language (you can choose any language to write your summary in, but don't mix languages)
