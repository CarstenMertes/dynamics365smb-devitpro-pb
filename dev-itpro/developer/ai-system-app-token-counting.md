# Token counting in AI

Large Language Models (LLMs) operate using tokens, which are representations of ASCII or other encoded characters, rather than directly processing these characters as input or output. Token counting is the process of determining the number of tokens that will be used by your input before sending an actual request to Azure OpenAI (AOAI). A simple example to illustrate token counting is the following:

Input: "Tell me about the solar system."  
Tokens: 41551 757 922 279 13238 1887 13  
Number of tokens: 7  

(The spacing between the numbers in the above example has been added purely for readability.)

Evaluating the number of tokens in your input is important because it helps you understand the cost of your request and the limitations of the model. By evaluating the number of tokens it takes for your request, you can determine the following:

- Estimating your potential cost of your copilot <Link to AOAI pricing page>. 
- Models have limited context sizes and when you have more data than what fits the context size, youâ€™d want to use this to help split up your generation into multiple generations.

## Token counting - AOAIToken codeunit

In the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] system application, there's a codeunit that can help you count the number of tokens in your input. The codeunit is located in GitHub BCApps repo in the following path: <!-- to be inserted -->.

The AOAIToken codeunit has the following methods:

- GetGPT35TokenCount(Input):Integer 
- GetGPT4TokenCount(Input):Integer 
- GetGPTAdaTokenCount(Input):Integer 
- GetGPTDavinciTokenCount(Input):Integer 

These methods are version agnostic. For example, GetGPT4TokenCount works for GPT4 0613, GPT4 0125, and all versions.
