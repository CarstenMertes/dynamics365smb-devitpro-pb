# About dates in Business Central

When you work with dates and time zones in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)], the following list provides insights on what's good to know.

- Every [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] user has a timezone specified on the page **User Settings**.
- When a user signs in to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] for the first time, this timezone is set using settings from the browser.
- [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] stores **all** `DateTime` fields as UTC and in the UI layer, we convert these fields to the timezone, specified by the user on the **User Settings** page.
- Two users might see a timestamp differently, but the point-in-time is the same.
- The **Time Zone** field on the **User Settings** page is in the UI and is only known by the client. You can't set a time zone per user on the **User Card** page in Business Central.
- Web Services connections are running using the UTC timezone and all `DateTime` types transferred in OData include a time zone as well. 
- The places in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)], where you still see `Date` fields are there because these fields donâ€™t represent a timestamp. Instead, they represent a date for financial reporting or similar.
- `Date` fields are never converted per time zone; a date value stays as it was entered.
- The user enters the posting date in the UI, which represents the date on which this line is posted in the journal.
- The date and time is always displayed as local time in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)]. Local time is determined by the time zone regional settings used by your computer. You must always enter date and time as local time. When you enter date and time as local time, it's converted to UTC using the current settings for the time zone and daylight saving time.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Issues can occur when the posting date field is defaulted in code using the `Today` method or using a conversion from a `DateTime` to `Date`. This conversion uses the user's timezone. Based on the current settings, it's not possible to guess what the right date for a conversion like that is. Today UTC is used, which for businesses in the US and Australia will surface immediately.
