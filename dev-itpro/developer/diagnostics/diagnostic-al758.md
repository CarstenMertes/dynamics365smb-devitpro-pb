[!INCLUDE[banner_preview](../includes/banner_preview.md)]

The name of {0} '{1}' conflicts with {0} '{2}' defined in {3} '{4}' by the extension '{5}'. Please choose another name for one of them. Otherwise, this might cause runtime issues.


> [!IMPORTANT]
> This warning will become an error with Business Central 2024 release wave 1.  

## Description
 Whitespaces in names are internally replaced with an underscore during compilation, such that two different names can collide.
