The length of the application object identifier '{0}' cannot exceed {1} characters.

## Description
The length of an application object identifier cannot exceed 30 characters.  

[//]: # (IMPORTANT: END>DO_NOT_EDIT)

## Remarks

This diagnostic will be triggered, for example, if you create a permission set with a name longer than 30 characters, with the `Assignable` property set to `false`. For permission sets specifically, the diagnostic will also be triggered, if a permission set with the `Assignable` property set to `true` exceeds 20 characters.

```al
permissionset 50111 NameExceeds30CharactersByFivePlusSome
{
    Assignable = false;
    Permissions = 
        table Customer = X;
}
```

```al
permissionset 50112 NameExceeds20Characters
{
    Assignable = false;
    Permissions = 
        table Customer = X;
}
```
