The method '{0}' is not supported as the implementation for the interface method because it is a try function.


> [!IMPORTANT]
> This warning will become an error with Business Central 2024 release wave 2.

Try functions cannot be used as interface method implementations because this can lead to unexpected behavior from the runtime.
