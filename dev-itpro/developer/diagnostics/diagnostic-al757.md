[!INCLUDE[banner_preview](../includes/banner_preview.md)]

The name of {0} '{1}' conflicts with {0} '{2}' defined in {3} '{4}' by the extension '{5}'. Choose another name for one of them. Otherwise, this might cause runtime issues.


## Description
White spaces in names are internally replaced with an underscore during compilation, so that two different names can collide.
