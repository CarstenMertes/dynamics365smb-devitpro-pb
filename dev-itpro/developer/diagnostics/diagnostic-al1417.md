[!INCLUDE[banner_preview](../includes/banner_preview.md)]

The {0} '{1}' cannot be added relatively to '{2}' because '{2}' is missing. '{1}' is added at a default location instead.


## Description
The anchor of an add (action or view) cannot be resolved because its declaring extension is not installed anymore. The elements are added into a default location.
