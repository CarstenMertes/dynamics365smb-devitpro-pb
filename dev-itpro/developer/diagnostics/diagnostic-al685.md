[!INCLUDE[banner_preview](../includes/banner_preview.md)]

The length '{0}' of the calculation formula's target field '{1}' is greater than the length '{2}' of the source flow field '{3}'. This could result in a runtime error. Please make sure that the target field's length is less than equal to the source field length.
