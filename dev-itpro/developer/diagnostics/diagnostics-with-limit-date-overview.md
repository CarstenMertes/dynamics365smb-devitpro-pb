|Release|Diagnostics|Message|
|---------|-----------|------|

Remove the explicit dependency.<br /> - Enum values can't be nested. Use '{0}' instead.<br /> - The name of a dataitem cannot be empty because it can cause runtime errors.<br /> - The '{0}' already defines a built-in member called '{1}'. Choose another name for {2} '{1}', or it might cause runtime issues.<br /> - The name of {0} '{1}' conflicts with {0} '{2}' defined in {3} '{4}' by the extension '{5}'. Please choose another name for one of them. Otherwise, this might cause runtime issues.<br /> - The identifier '{0}' cannot have any leading or trailing spaces.<br /> - Try methods should not specify an explicit return value, because the value will be discarded.

A valid key vault URL must use HTTPS and point to the Azure key vault domain.<br />|
|2023 release wave 1| - [AL0711](diagnostic-al711.md) <br /> | - A member of type {0} with name '{1}' is already defined in {2} '{3}' by the extension '{4}'. Duplicate member names are not allowed when defining CueActions.<br />|
