# Test the Copilot capability in AL

Copilot features can dramatically improve user productivity, but only when they’re reliable. Since LLMs generate output based on probabilistic patterns, traditional rule-based testing approaches aren’t sufficient. The next articles help developers and testers adapt their strategies to ensure high-quality, trustworthy Copilot experiences.

## Why test Copilot features?

Testing helps ensure that Copilot features:

- Deliver accurate, relevant responses  
- Respond consistently to similar user prompts  
- Avoid producing harmful, biased, or inappropriate content  

Without proper validation, AI-generated outputs can lead to user frustration, compliance risks, and brand damage.
