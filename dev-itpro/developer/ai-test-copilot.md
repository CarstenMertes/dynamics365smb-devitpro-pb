# Test the Copilot capability in AL

Copilot features can dramatically improve user productivity, but only when they’re reliable. Since LLMs generate output based on probabilistic patterns, traditional rule-based testing approaches aren’t sufficient. The next articles help developers and testers adapt their strategies to ensure high-quality, trustworthy Copilot experiences.

## Why test Copilot features?

Testing helps ensure that Copilot features:

- Deliver accurate, relevant responses  
- Respond consistently to similar user prompts  
- Avoid producing harmful, biased, or inappropriate content  

Without proper validation, AI-generated outputs can lead to user frustration, compliance risks, and brand damage.

In the next articles, we’ll explore how to test Copilot features in Business Central using the AI Test Tool. This tool allows you to create and run tests that validate the accuracy, safety, and reliability of your Copilot features.
