# Pragma Directive in AL

[!INCLUDE[2020_releasewave2](../../includes/2020_releasewave2.md)]

## Pragma

The `#pragma` directive gives the compiler special instructions for the compilation of the file in which it appears. The `#pragma` directive has many actions that can be used with the pragma instructions in the following sections, which are `disable`, `restore`, and `enable`.

AL supports the following pragma instructions:

- [Pragma ImplicitWith](devenv-directive-pragma-implicitwith.md)
- [Pragma Warning](devenv-directive-pragma-warning.md)
