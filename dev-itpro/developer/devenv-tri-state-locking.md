# Tri-state locking in database

The tri-state locking feature is aimed at enhancing the performance and concurrency of database transactions. By enabling this feature, AL-based read operations that follow write operations are performed optimistically, rather than with strict consistency and low concurrency. Consequently, users can expect higher levels of concurrency and fewer blocked or failed operations while accessing data. 

> [!NOTE]
> Explicitly using the [LockTable](methods-auto/record/record-locktable-method.md) method in code will maintain the same behavior, disabling optimistic reads.

## Locking behavior

The [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] server uses database locks on a table when a session starts to change data in the table. The following examples illustrate the locking behavior in versions 22 and earlier compared to how tri-state locking works.

```AL
// locking behavior in versions 22 (and earlier)
trigger OnAction()
var
    currency1: Record Currency;
    currency2: Record Currency;    
begin
    currency1.FindFirst(); // SQL statement use READUNCOMMITTED

    currency1.Code := 'DKK';
    currency1."ISO Code" := 'DKK';
    currency1.Symbol := 'Kr';
    currency1.Insert();

    currency2.FindLast(); // SQL statement use UPDLOCK (so locks data with an exclusive lock)
end;
```  

Contrast this behavior with how locks are taken with tri-state locking.

```AL
// locking behaviour with tri-state locking
trigger OnAction()
var
    currency1: Record Currency;
    currency2: Record Currency;    
begin
    currency1.FindFirst(); // SQL statement use READUNCOMMITTED

    currency1.Code := 'DKK';
    currency1."ISO Code" := 'DKK';
    currency1.Symbol := 'Kr';
    currency1.Insert();

    currency2.FindLast(); // SQL statement use READCOMMITTED (so locks data with a shared lock)
end;
```  

In both cases, the locking behavior is about what happens in a session after a record instance has done a data modification (insert/update/delete) on a table. 

| Properties | Locking behavior in versions 22 (and earlier) | Locking behavior with tri-state locking  | 
| ---------- | ----- | ---------  | 
| Default isolation level for subsequent operations | UpdLock | ReadCommitted |
| Locking behavior | Session would acquire update lock on data from the table until it committed or rolled back its changes.  | Session will only acquire a shared lock when reading data. |
| Consequences | Could cause blocking and contention issues when multiple sessions tried to access or modify the same table. | Allows other sessions to read and write to the same table concurrently, if they don't conflict with each other's changes. |


## Next steps

The feature is enabled by default, but you can turn it on or off using the **Enable Tri-State locking in AL** switch on the Feature Management page in Business Central. Changes take effect for users the next time they sign in to Business Central. [Learn more about enabling upcoming features ahead of time](../administration/feature-management.md).

If you're using Business Central on-premises, the `EnableTriStateLocking` setting in the server configuration must also be set to `true` to enable tri-state locking. [Learn more about configuring the server](../administration/configure-server-instance.md#Database).
