# Integrating Business Central with Microsoft 365 

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] supports multiple integrations to Microsoft 365.

Here are some supported integrations between Business Central and Microsoft 365:

- [!INCLUDE[m365_onedrive_for_business](includes/m365-onedrive-for-business-name.md)]
- [!INCLUDE[m365_teams](includes/m365-teams-name.md)]


## Integrating to [!INCLUDE[m365_onedrive_for_business](includes/m365-onedrive-for-business-name.md)]

[!INCLUDE[m365_onedrive_for_business](includes/m365-onedrive-for-business-name.md)] is a cloud storage service that is included in Microsoft 365. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] makes it easy to store, manage, and share files with other people through OneDrive. When [!INCLUDE[m365_onedrive_for_business](includes/m365-onedrive-for-business-name.md)] is enabled in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)], additional functionality becomes available such as 

- *Open in OneDrive* and *Share* actions are available on most pages where files are available, such as the Report Inbox or where files are attached to records. 
- The Open in Excel and Edit in Excel actions on list pages will automatically copy the Excel file to OneDrive, then open it in Excel Online. 
- Sending a report to an Excel or Word file will automatically copy the file to OneDrive, then open it in the Excel or Word online. 

For more information, see [Integrating with Onedrive for Business overview](/dynamics365/business-central/across-onedrive-overview).

With [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] online, the connection between [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] and OneDrive is automatically configured, and the OneDrive features are readily available to users by default. With [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, it requires more set. For more information, see [Managing OneDrive Integration with Business Central](/dynamics365/business-central/admin-onedrive-integration).


## Integrating to Microsoft Teams

You can integrate [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] apps/extensions with [!INCLUDE[m365_teams](includes/m365-teams-name.md)]. [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] offers an app that connects [!INCLUDE[m365_teams](includes/m365-teams-name.md)] to the data in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] so that users can quickly share details across team members and respond faster to inquiries.
