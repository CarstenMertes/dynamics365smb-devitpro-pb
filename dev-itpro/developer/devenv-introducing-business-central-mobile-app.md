# Introducing the Dynamics 365 Business Central Mobile App
The app displaying the [!INCLUDE[nav_tablet](includes/nav_tablet_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[nav_phone](includes/nav_phone_md.md)] is targeted at users in small and medium sized businesses that want to access data from a tablet or a phone. The main advantages of this offering are portability and flexibility, which allows end users to perform tasks when they are away from their desk. Having a [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long_md](includes/d365fin_long_md.md)] solution that runs on a smaller device also brings it in the hands of many more users and your app is easy to distribute. 

<!-- Some of the advantages of offering this solution are portability and flexibility, when the user is away from the desk, on the train, between meetings, passing time and so on.  
   -->
 <!-- The tablet is lighter than a laptop, and thereby provides portability. Most tablets have an on-screen keyboard, but the keyboard plays a less central role on the tablet, and this forces you to have to consider the touch experience.  
  
 The phone is a very light device and has an even smaller screen than tablets, which is why the tasks that usually make sense to perform using the phone are brief and typically reading of data or very lightweight data entry, such as approving an invoice or getting an overview of the business.  -->
  
 <!--Studies show that design for phone apps must cater for one-hand use; and in some cases, when switching to a panorama view, users will use both hands. 
 The [!INCLUDE[nav_phone](includes/nav_phone_md.md)] layout is designed to support one-hand and both hands use, which allows the important data and buttons to be available within thumbs reach.  -->

Other advantages are that using a tablet or phone, you can capture data closer to the source, for example, at the customer site, and thereby improve accuracy and reduce end-to-end time.   -->
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The [!INCLUDE[nav_tablet](includes/nav_tablet_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[nav_phone](includes/nav_phone_md.md)] do not replace the [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)]. Instead, they offer a touch interface for a limited set of application scenarios compared to the [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)]. 

The [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)] supports more complex business processes and heavier data entry than it is possible on the [!INCLUDE[nav_tablet](includes/nav_tablet_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[nav_phone](includes/nav_phone_md.md)]. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is also designed for intensive use, and the user can have multiple windows open at the same time, but this is neither possible in [!INCLUDE[nav_phone](includes/nav_phone_md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[nav_tablet](includes/nav_tablet_md.md)]. For more information, see [Differences and Limitations When Developing Pages for the Business Central Mobile App](devenv-differences-and-limitations-developing-pages-business-central-mobile-app.md).

The design for the [!INCLUDE[nav_tablet](includes/nav_tablet_md.md)] is optimized for the touch experience and reduced use of the on-screen keyboard.
On the other hand, the design for the [!INCLUDE[nav_phone](includes/nav_phone_md.md)] is about touch optimization, given its smaller screen size. The [!INCLUDE[nav_phone](includes/nav_phone_md.md)] layout is designed to support one-hand and both hands use, which allows the important data and buttons to be available within thumbs reach.

> [!NOTE]  
> In this documentation, you will see mentions of [!INCLUDE[nav_tablet](includes/nav_tablet_md.md)], [!INCLUDE[nav_phone](includes/nav_phone_md.md)], and *Dynamics 365 Business Central Mobile App*. [!INCLUDE[nav_tablet](includes/nav_tablet_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[nav_phone](includes/nav_phone_md.md)] describe the interface tailored to the category of mobile device, which is one of the tools available for developers for designing mobile solutions, whereas *Dynamics 365 Business Central Mobile App* is the common name for the app across all devices; the end result made with these tools.  
  
## Considering the user scenarios  
When you design your solution for the [!INCLUDE[nav_tablet](includes/nav_tablet_md.md)] and the [!INCLUDE[nav_phone](includes/nav_phone_md.md)], you must make sure that scenarios are simple enough to be meaningful and usable. The tablet and phone designs are meant for lighter tasks and are useful, for example, for traveling salespeople or service technicians who need a portable, online, easy-to-use app that provides an overview, for example, of daily tasks and items in stock.  
  
Depending on the scenarios that your tablet and phone solution will support, it will either make sense to create a new Role Center for tablet and phone only, or share the same Role Center across all of the client types. In some cases, it can make sense to have a user sign in with two different profiles, one for a desktop client and one for mobile devices. In other cases, duplicating pages and designing specific duplicates to be device-oriented is the best solution.  
  
If you have existing page objects that you want to make available on [!INCLUDE[nav_tablet](includes/nav_tablet_md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[nav_phone](includes/nav_phone_md.md)], we strongly recommend that you plan time to evaluate carefully which actions, sections, and fields will be needed for the user scenarios you want to enable. Fields and actions that are not needed should not be visible to users of your app. The UI must be simplified significantly to work well on a small device.

## Supported credential types  
[!INCLUDE[nav_tablet](includes/nav_tablet_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[nav_phone](includes/nav_phone_md.md)] support the same credential types as [!INCLUDE[nav_web](includes/nav_web_md.md)]. For more information, see [Authentication and Credential Types](../administration/users-credential-types.md).
