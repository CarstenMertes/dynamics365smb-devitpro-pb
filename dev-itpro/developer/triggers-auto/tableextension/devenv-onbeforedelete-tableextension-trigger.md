# OnBeforeDelete (Table Extension) Trigger
> **Version**: _Available or changed with runtime version 1.0._

Runs when the user tries to delete a record.


## Syntax
```AL
trigger OnBeforeDelete()
begin
    ...
end;
```



[//]: # (IMPORTANT: END>DO_NOT_EDIT)

## Remarks  
 This trigger runs before the default delete behavior is executed on a record to be deleted. It runs automatically after the user chooses to delete a record in a page from the Web client. The record is not deleted if an error occurs in the trigger code.
