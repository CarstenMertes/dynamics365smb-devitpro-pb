# OnBeforeInsert (Table Extension) Trigger
> **Version**: _Available or changed with runtime version 1.0._

Runs when a user inserts a new record into the table.


## Syntax
```AL
trigger OnBeforeInsert()
begin
    ...
end;
```



[//]: # (IMPORTANT: END>DO_NOT_EDIT)

## Remarks  
 This trigger is run before default insert behavior, which checks that the record to be inserted does not already exist before the insertion occurs. It runs automatically after the user chooses to insert a new record in a page from the Web Client. The new record is not inserted if an error occurs in the trigger code.
