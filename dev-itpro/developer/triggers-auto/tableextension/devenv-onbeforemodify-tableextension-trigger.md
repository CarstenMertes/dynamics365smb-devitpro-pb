# OnBeforeModify (Table Extension) Trigger
> **Version**: _Available or changed with runtime version 1.0._

Runs when a user modifies an existing record in a table.


## Syntax
```AL
trigger OnBeforeModify()
begin
    ...
end;
```



[//]: # (IMPORTANT: END>DO_NOT_EDIT)

## Remarks  
 This trigger is run before the default modify behavior, which checks that all the fields of a record are valid before the modification occurs. It runs automatically when the user changes at least one field (different from the primary key field) of a record in a page from the Web Client. If an error occurs in the trigger code, the record changes are canceled.
