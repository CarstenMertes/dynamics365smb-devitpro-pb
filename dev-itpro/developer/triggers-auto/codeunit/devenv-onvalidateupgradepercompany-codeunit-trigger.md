# OnValidateUpgradePerCompany (Codeunit) Trigger
> **Version**: _Available or changed with runtime version 1.0._

Runs after an extension upgrade.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The [Subtype Property](../../properties/devenv-subtype-property.md) must be set to **Upgrade** in the Codeunit.

## Syntax
```AL
trigger OnValidateUpgradePerCompany()
begin
    ...
end;
```



[//]: # (IMPORTANT: END>DO_NOT_EDIT)

> [!NOTE]  
>  This trigger is also available in upgrade codeunits for the base application, not just for extensions.  

## Remarks  
It is used to check that the upgrade was successful. If an error occurs during runtime the extension upgrade is canceled.

This trigger is run once for each company in the database, and it is executed within its own system session for the company.
