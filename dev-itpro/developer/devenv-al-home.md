The **AL Home** view shows news related to developing in AL for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The **AL Home** view allows the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] research and development department to efficiently share news, best practices, upcoming events, urgent information and status, and learn content. 

> [!TIP]  
> To open the **AL Home** view from within Visual Studio Code, press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd>, and then choose **AL: Home**.

## Settings

You can choose when to show the **AL Home** view as you start up Visual Studio Code, the default is that **AL Home** is shown when it's updated.
