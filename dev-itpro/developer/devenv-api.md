# API development overview

[!INCLUDE [getstarted-contributions](includes/getstarted-contributions.md)]

RESTful web services are typically created to interchange data between [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] and external systems. The acronym REST stands for REpresentational State Transfer. Any coding language capable of calling REST APIs can be used to use this feature. The [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] API stack have been optimized for performance and is the preferred way to integrate with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)].

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] comes with an extensive list of built-in APIs that requires no code and minimal setup to use. You can also develop your own custom APIs using the AL object types _API pages_ and _API queries._ This article helps you get started developing your own APIs.

[!INCLUDE[extending_APIs_is_not_supported_note](includes/include-extending-APIs-is-not-supported-note.md)]

## Creating APIs

When creating an API, you need to consider how the API is intended to be used: 

* If you need to read and write data, use a page of the type `API`
* If you just need to read data, possibly from multiple tables, use a query of the type `API`

The two approaches come with different characteristics as described in this table:

|Method to expose data as an API | Properties |
|---------------------------|------------|
| API Page   | Support read-write operations <br> Webhook-supported <br> Cannot be extended <br> Expose data from one table |
| API Query  | Read-only operations <br> Cannot be extended <br> Can expose data from multiple tables |


> [!TIP]  
> For inspiration and examples, see the open source [ALAppExtensions](https://github.com/microsoft/ALAppExtensions/tree/main/Apps/W1/APIV2/app/src/pages) repo. Here you'll find examples of API pages written in AL.
