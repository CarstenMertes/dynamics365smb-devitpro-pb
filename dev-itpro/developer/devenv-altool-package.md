# AL Development Tools package

When you install the AL Development Tools package, you gain access to a set of command-line utilities designed to streamline AL extension development and automation. The main features include:

- **ALTool command-line utility**: A cross-platform tool for compiling, packaging, and managing AL extensions outside of Visual Studio Code.
- **Integration with CI/CD pipelines**: Easy automation of build and deployment processes for your AL projects in Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions, or other automation platforms.
- **Multiple installation options**: The tools package is available as a NuGet package, making it simple to install on build agents or local machines using standard package management workflows.
- **No need for full Visual Studio Code installation**: Using the ALTool independently is ideal for automated environments or lightweight setups.
- **Support for various ALTool commands**: Compile, create symbol packages, retrieve manifests, and moreâ€”all from the command line.
