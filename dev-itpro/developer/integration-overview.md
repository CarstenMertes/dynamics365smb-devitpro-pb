# Integration overview for Business Central online

This article is intended to help architects and developers make sound design decisions when they implement integration scenarios to and from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)].

The article describes integration patterns, integration scenarios, and integration solutions. However, it doesn't include technical details about how to use or set up every integration pattern. It also doesn't include sample integration code.


## How to expose web service endpoints

All integrations to/from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] are done using web services. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] supports three types of web services: API, SOAP, and OData. 

The recommended way to expose a web service for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] is using the API stack. 

For more information, see [Web services overview](../webservices/web-services.md).


## How to explore and develop against Business Central APIs

When you need to connect to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] from another application, you should use APIs, either the built-in APIs or custom APIs. 

For more information about built-in APIs, see [REST API overview](../webservices/api-overview.md).

For more information on how to explore and develop against APIs, see [Developing Connect apps](../developer/devenv-develop-connect-apps.md).


## Business Central connector for Power Platform

A *connector* is a proxy or a wrapper around an API that allows the user of the connector to talk to the underlying service. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] has its own connector that allows Power Platform products such as Power Automate, Power Apps, and Logic apps to communicate with 
[!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)].

For more information, see [Connectors Overview](/connectors/connectors) and [Dynamics 365 Business Central](/connectors/dynamicssmbsaas) in the Power Platform documentation.


## Integrating Business Central with Microsoft Power Apps

You can integrate [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] with Microsoft Power Apps by using the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] connector for Power Platform. With Power Apps, you have the flexibility to build the perfect solution for your business domain&mdash;one that uses [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] data and processes and maximizes your productivity. With Power Apps custom UI, AI builder, and augmented-reality (AR)/mixed-reality (MR) technologies, you can take your business to the next level with cutting-edge innovation and customized UI. 

For more information, see [Integrating with Microsoft Power Apps overview](../powerplatform/power-apps-overview.md)


## Integrating Business Central with Microsoft Power Automate

You can integrate [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] with Microsoft Power Automate by using the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] connector for Power Platform. With Power Automate, you can set up and use flows to connect business-process tasks performed by different users. System tasks, such as automatic posting, can be included as steps in flows, preceded or followed by user tasks. Requesting and granting approval to create new records are typical flow steps.

For more information, see [Integrating with Microsoft Power Automate overview](../powerplatform/power-automate-overview.md)


## Integrating Business Central with Microsoft Power Pages (preview)

You can integrate [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] with Microsoft Power Pages by using virtual tables in Dataverse. With Power Pages, you can allow unlicensed external users to access data stored in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] online.

For more information, see [Integrating with Microsoft Power Pages (preview)](../developer/power-pages-on-virtual-tables-overview.md).


## Integrating Business Central with Microsoft Power BI

You can integrate [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] with Microsoft Power BI in two ways:
1. Connect a Power BI semantic model to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] to read data,
1. Embed a Power BI report, page, or visual in the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] client.

**How to connect a Power BI semantic model to Business Central to read data**

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] integrates with Power BI through a connector using OData. The connector can read data from API pages/queries and from UI pages exposed as OData web services.

For more information, see [Power BI integration overview](/dynamics365/business-central/admin-powerbi-overview).


**How to embed a Power BI report, page, or visual in the Business Central client**

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] supports that a Power BI report, page, or visual can be embedded in the Business Central client by using an iframe. 

There are two ways that a Power BI report, page, or visual can be added to a page in the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] client:
1. A user can embed a Power BI report, page, or scorecard on pages that include a Power BI part. For more information, see [Working with Power BI Reports in Business Central](/dynamics365/business-central/across-working-with-powerbi).
1. A developer can programatically add them from AL. For more information, see [Adding Power BI Report parts to pages](../developer/devenv-power-bi-report-parts.md).


## Built-in: Integrating Business Central with Dataverse

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] has four built-in ways to integrate with [!INCLUDE[dataverse_short](../includes/dataverse_short.md)]: 

- Data synchronization that replicates data between [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] and [!INCLUDE[dataverse_short](../includes/dataverse_short.md)].
- Data virtualization with virtual tables in [!INCLUDE[dataverse_short](../includes/dataverse_short.md)] via [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] API for (**C**reate/**R**ead/**U**pdate/**D**elete) operations.
- Data change (**CUD**) events using webhooks.
- Business events (preview).

For more information, see [Integrating Business Central with Microsoft Dataverse](dataverse-integration-overview.md).


## Built-in: Integrating Business Central with Dynamics 365 Sales

You can integrate [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] with Dynamics 365 Sales by first setting up integration to [!INCLUDE[dataverse_short](../includes/dataverse_short.md)] and then do more setup from the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] application. Integrating to Dynamics 365 Sales lets users view information from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] while they're working in Dynamics 365 Sales. For example, when preparing a sales quote it could be useful to know whether you have enough inventory to fulfill the order.

For more information, see [Integrating Business Central with Dynamics 365 Sales](/dynamics365/business-central/admin-prepare-dynamics-365-for-sales-for-integration)  


## Built-in: Integrating Business Central with Shopify

You can integrate [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] with Shopify by installing and configuring the Shopify Connector app. By connecting your Shopify store (or stores) with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)], you can maximize your business productivity and manage and view insights from your business and your Shopify store as one unit.

For more information, see [Get started with the Shopify connector](/dynamics365/business-central/shopify/get-started).


## Integrating to external systems from AL code: calling external services

You can integrate [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] apps/extensions with external systems by using the *HttpClient* data type in AL code. 

For more information, see [Integrating to external services with the HttpClient data type](../developer/devenv-httpclient.md).
