# Extension Development Lifecycle Overview

This section describes the different phases a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] extension goes through from initial development until it gets deprovisioned.

The lifecycle is the cyclical software development process that typically involves these areas: plan and track, develop, build and test, deploy, operate, monitor, and learn from discovery. The following illustration outlines the phases involved.
