## Example

```AL
RequestFilterHeadingML = DAN='Kundeliste'; // Customer list
```

## Remarks

**RequestFilterHeadingML** is multilanguage-enabled. This means that it can contain a list of text in different languages. The text that is used will be selected according to the current language setting of the user. The **RequestFilterHeadingML** property has the following format.  
  
<*Language ID*>=<*ReqFilterHeading*>  
  
<*Language ID*> is a Windows standard three-letter language ID and <*ReqFilterHeading*> is the caption text for this language. Semicolons separate entries.  

You can enter values for the **RequestFilterHeadingML** property in the following ways:  
  
- If you enter a **RequestFilterHeadingML**, this value will be inserted in **RequestFilterHeadingML** as the value for the language that is currently selected. If the language is set to Danish when a value is entered in **RequestFilterHeadingML**, **RequestFilterHeadingML** will be updated with a DAN=<*value*> string. You have to use the abbreviated name (DAN for Danish, for example) of the languages.
