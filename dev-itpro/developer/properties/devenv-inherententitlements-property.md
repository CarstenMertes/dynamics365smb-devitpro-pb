[//]: # (IMPORTANT: END>DO_NOT_EDIT)


## Remarks

The inherent entitlements permission values that are *Read*, *Insert*, *Modify*, *Delete*, and *Execute* are set according to the object type. For example, a Report object can have an execute 'X' permission, but the same permission is not valid for data in a Table object.

## Syntax 

```AL

InherentEntitlements = Permissions;

```

## Example 

```AL

table 50145 NewItem
{
    DataClassification = ToBeClassified;
    InherentEntitlements = RI;
   
    fields
    {
        
        field(2, ItemName; Text)    
        {
            DataClassification = ToBeClassified;
        
        }  

    }
}
```
