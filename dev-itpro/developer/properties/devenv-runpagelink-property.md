# RunPageLink Property
> **Version**: _Available or changed with runtime version 1.0._

Sets a link to a page that will be launched for this action.
The following syntax is valid for the RunPageLink property:

```
RunPageLink = <TableFilters>
<TableFilters> ::= <TableFilter> {,<TableFilter>}
<TableFilter> ::= <RunObjectFieldName> = CONST(<FieldConst>) | FILTER(<Filter>) | FIELD(<SourceFieldName>) |
FIELD(UPPERLIMIT(<SourceFieldName>)) | FIELD(FILTER(<SourceFieldName>)) | FIELD(UPPERLIMIT(FILTER(<SourceFieldName>)))
```

The filters defined by this property are visible in the UI and can be modified by end-users. If it was intended to hide them from end-users, consider using the RunPageView property instead.


## Applies to
-   Page Action

[//]: # (IMPORTANT: END>DO_NOT_EDIT)


> [!NOTE]  
> This property is supported only on actions for pages.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> For performance reasons, always set the `RunPageView` property if the `RunPageLink` property is also set. In fact, the sort order chosen in the `RunPageView` property must contain the fields listed in the `RunPageLink` property or else the performance is decreased.

## Syntax example

```AL
action(ShowVendors)
{ 
    ...
    RunObject = page "Vendor Card";
    RunPageLink = "ID"=field(Id);
    ...
}
```

```AL
action(CustomerBalance)
{   
    ...
    RunObject = page "Customer List";
    RunPageLink = "Balance (LCY)"=filter(>=10000);
    ...
}
```

## Remarks

For example, if the current page is the customer card and you need to provide a way to see the outstanding sales orders for the current customer, you would use the [RunObject Property](devenv-runobject-property.md) to run the customer sales orders page. In this property you would select the `Customer No.` field as the link between the two pages.
