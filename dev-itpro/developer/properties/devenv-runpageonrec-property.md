Sets the same record on the page you launch from this control as is already displayed on the current page.

## Applies to
-   Page Action

[//]: # (IMPORTANT: END>DO_NOT_EDIT)


## Property Value  

**True** if the current record on the page that you will launch from this control is displayed; otherwise, **false**. The default is **false**.  

## Syntax

```AL
RunPageOnRec = true;
```
  
## Remarks  

For example, suppose the current page is the sales order and you are providing a way to see the sales statistics for the current customer. You would select RunObject in the PushAction property and use the [RunObject Property](devenv-runobject-property.md) to run the sales statistics page. In this property you could select Yes to display the same record on both pages.
