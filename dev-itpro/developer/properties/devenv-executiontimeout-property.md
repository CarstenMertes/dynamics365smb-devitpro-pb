Sets the maximum time the report will run after which it is automatically terminated.

## Applies to
-   Report

[//]: # (IMPORTANT: END>DO_NOT_EDIT)

## Property Value

A string in the format `hh:mm:ss`.

## Remarks

At runtime, this property will override the limit that is set by the **Default Max Rendering Timeout** (ReportDefaultTimeout) setting for [!INCLUDE[server](../includes/server.md)] instance. The [!INCLUDE[server](../includes/server.md)] instance also includes the **Max Rendering Timeout (hard limit)** (ReportTimeout) setting, which this property won't override.

For more information on report limits, see [Report limits](../devenv-report-object.md#report-limits).
