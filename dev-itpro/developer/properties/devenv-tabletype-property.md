## Syntax

```AL
TableType = CDS;
```

## Remarks

Tables that are marked as **CDS** or **ExternalSQL** are considered external tables that are not managed by [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long_md](../includes/d365fin_long_md.md)]. These tables use a different SQL Server connection than the normal tables in the [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long_md](../includes/d365fin_long_md.md)] database.

> [!NOTE]  
> Tables of types `CRM` and `CDS` are used to create outgoing service calls towards Dataverse and Dynamics 365 Apps. Such calls are not counted against [Business Central API limits](../../administration/operational-limits-online.md), but are counted against [Power Platform request limits](/power-platform/admin/api-request-limits-allocations#non-licensed-user-request-limits).

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> We advise against creating tables of type CRM/CDS manually. Instead, use the [AL Table Proxy Generator](../devenv-al-table-proxy-generator.md).

## Temporary tables

Marking a table as **Temporary** is the same as:

- Setting "SourceTableTemporary" on all pages that use the table. See [SourceTableTemporary Property](devenv-sourcetabletemporary-property.md).  

Temporary tables are not synchronized with the SQL database, so they do not follow the same rules about making destructive changes.

You can change an existing table from **Normal** to **Temporary**. But the table will be deleted from the database when you synchronize the extension. If the table contains data, you'll have to use the ForceSync mode.

For more information, see [Temporary Tables](../devenv-temporary-tables.md).
