[//]: # (IMPORTANT: END>DO_NOT_EDIT)

## Property Value

An integer
 
## Syntax

```AL
MaximumDocumentCount = 100;
```

## Remarks

At runtime, this property will override the hard limit that is set by the **Default Max Documents** (ReportDefaultMaxDocuments) setting for [!INCLUDE[server](../includes/server.md)] instance. The [!INCLUDE[server](../includes/server.md)] instance also includes the **Max Documents (hard limit)** (ReportMaxDocuments) setting, which this property won't override.

For more information on report limits, see [Report limits](../devenv-report-object.md#report-limits).
