## Remarks

> [!NOTE]  
> With [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] 2022 release wave 2, the way that you promote actions on pages or page extensions has changed. Promoting actions is defined in a specific section of the page definition and contains a reference to the action. For more information, see [Promoted Actions](../devenv-promoted-actions.md).

Promoted actions appear in the action bar on a page. You promote an action by setting the [Promoted Property](devenv-promoted-property.md). Categories allow you to group similar actions under a common caption. You can choose between 10 categories: New, Process, Report, and Category4 through Category10. By default, the category names are used as the captions in the ribbon. <!--For information about changing the captions, see [How to: Define Promoted Action Categories Captions for the Ribbon](How-to-Define-Promoted-Action-Categories-Captions-for-the-Ribbon.md).  -->
