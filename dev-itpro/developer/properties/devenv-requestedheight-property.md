RequestedHeight specifies the initial height of the control add-in.

## Applies to
-   Control Add In

[//]: # (IMPORTANT: END>DO_NOT_EDIT)


## Value Type 

- Integer 

## Property Values

The default value is 100 pixels.

## Remarks 

This setting is optional. You can use it when the visual content of the add-in is optimal at a specific size. If space is available on the page, the requested height will be applied. If the add-in must compete for space with other content on the page, such as a second add-in, then the RequestedHeight value is ignored and the add-in will shrink or stretch to the minimum or maximum height.
The value of RequestedHeight is ignored if the add-in is the only content on a card page.

## Example

```AL
RequestedHeight = 300;
VerticalShrink = true;
MinimumHeight = 150;
```
