## Remarks  

**RecordSeparator** property is only used if the **Format Property** is set to **Variable Text** or **Fixed Text**. Otherwise, the setting is ignored.

This property specifies how records should be separated. The default value is a new line \(**\<NewLine>**\). 
 
The strings in the preceding table must be entered literally, that is, the **<** and **>** characters must be entered. These special strings can be combined and can be mixed with other characters.  

CR refers to the character with ASCII value 13.  
  
LF refers to the character with ASCII value 10.  
  
You can set the record separator in AL code so that the XMLport can import and export records with different separators. For example, if your XMLport must import from a file or stream where one record uses **NewLine** and another uses **TAB**, you can change the record separator at run time.  

> [!NOTE]
> Do not use a semicolon in a quoted argument as other properties' value when you import a file through an XMLport. Even in a quoted argument, the semicolon is interpreted as a record separator.
