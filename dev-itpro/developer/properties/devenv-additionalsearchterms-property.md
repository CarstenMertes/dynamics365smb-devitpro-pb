## Parameters

If `true` the AdditionalSearchTerms is locked and should not be translated.  

*Comment*  
&emsp;Type: [Text](../methods-auto/text/text-data-type.md)  
Descriptive text for the AdditionalSearchTerms, for example, with regards to translation.

*MaxLength*  
&emsp;Type: [Integer](../methods-auto/integer/integer-data-type.md)

## Property Values

|Value           |Description                                  |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------|
|`<term>`  |The search word or phrase, which can consist of letters, numbers and special characters. Separate each term by a comma.  |

## Syntax

```AL
AdditionalSearchTerms = '<term>[,<term>]';
```

Or, with parameters:

```AL
AdditionalSearchTerms = '<term>[,<term>]'[, Locked = true|false][, Comment = '<instructions for translation>'][, MaxLength = <number of characters, like 20>];
```

## Remarks
For [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, the [!INCLUDE[webserverinstance](../includes/webserverinstance.md)] configuration file (navsettings.json) includes a setting called `UseAdditionalSearchTerms` that enables or disables the use of additional search terms by the **Tell me**. For more information, see [Configuring [!INCLUDE[webserver](../includes/webserver.md)] Instances](../../administration/configure-web-server.md#Settings).

## Dependent Properties

The [UsageCategory property](devenv-usagecategory-property.md) must be set to a value other than `None` in order for the page to be searchable by **Tell me**.

## Example

The following code snippet uses the **AdditionalSearchTerms** property to add two search terms, **product** and **merchandise**, to a list page whose caption is **Items**.

```AL
page 50100 MyItems
{
    PageType = List;
    ApplicationArea = All;
    SourceTable = Item;
    UsageCategory = Lists;
    Caption = 'Items';
    AdditionalSearchTerms = 'product, merchandise';
    ...
}
```
