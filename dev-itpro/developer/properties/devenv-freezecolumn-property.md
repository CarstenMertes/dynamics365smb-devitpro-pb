Specifies the columns in a list that remain in view on a page, even when you scroll right.

## Applies to
-   Page Group

[//]: # (IMPORTANT: END>DO_NOT_EDIT)

## Syntax

```AL
FreezeColumn = GroupCompanyDisplayName;
```

## Remarks

The property is useful when you have a list that has many columns that extend beyond the controlâ€™s boundaries, which require that you scroll right to see all columns. This property lets you specify columns that always remain in view, even when you scroll through the remaining columns. To set the property, you select a column. The column that you select and *all columns before it* remain in view on the page.
