## Remarks  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This property will be deprecated with a future release. We recommend that you **don't use** this property. Use the [DateFormula Data Type](../methods-auto/dateformula/dateformula-data-type.md) instead.  

For fields, this property only applies to text fields. In earlier versions of [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long_md](../includes/d365fin_long_md.md)], the property also applied to code fields, but this has been deprecated.
