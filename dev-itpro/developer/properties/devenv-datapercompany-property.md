# DataPerCompany Property
> **Version**: _Available or changed with runtime version 1.0._

Sets a value that indicates whether the table data applies to all companies in the database or only the current company.

## Applies to
-   Table

[//]: # (IMPORTANT: END>DO_NOT_EDIT)

## Property Value

**True** if data is available only to this company; otherwise, **false**. The default value is **true**.  

## Syntax

```AL
DataPerCompany = true;
```

## Remarks

Whether the value of this property can be changed is dependent on if the table holds data or not.

The value `true` means that data is available to the current company only, this is the default value. You can only set this property to `true` if the table is empty in all companies, or if the table holds data in only one company. You cannot change the value to `false` if there is data in the table in any of the companies. 

> [!NOTE]
> Switching to DataPerCompany requires you to synchronize the extension that includes the table, and any extension that extends the table, by using the ForceSync mode. Otherwise, you'll get an error like: `sync-navapp : Table '' ::The table '' changed datapercompany from 'False' to 'True' and that is not allowed.`. For more information about syncing an extension, see [Sync-NavApp cmdlet](/powershell/module/microsoft.dynamics.nav.apps.management/sync-navapp).
