## Property value
**True** if the index is clustered, otherwise **false**. The default is **false**.

## Syntax

```AL
Clustered = true;
```

## Remarks

A clustered index determines the physical order in which records are stored in the table. Using a clustered key can improve the time it takes to retrieve records. 

There can be only one clustered key on a table.

## Example

The following example defines a secondary key to be a clustered index. 

```AL
keys
{
    // the first key defined in the keys section is the primary key
    key(PrimaryKey; ID)
    {
        Clustered = false;
    }
    key(CustomerInfo; Name,Address,City)
    {
        Clustered = true;
    }
}
```
