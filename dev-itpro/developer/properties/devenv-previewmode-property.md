[//]: # (IMPORTANT: END>DO_NOT_EDIT)


## Syntax

```AL
PreviewMode = Normal;
```

## Remarks  

In the **Report â€“ Properties** window, in the **PreviewMode** field, specify how the report must open in preview mode. The default mode can be different to how the report prints on paper. If you want to make sure that users see the report as it will look on paper, choose **PrintLayout**.  

Regardless of your choice, users can change the display mode in the **Print Preview** window. For example, if you choose the default mode, users can choose the **Print Layout** button. However, if the AL code for the report uses the PREVIEW function to disable printing from the preview, then users cannot change the display mode to print layout.
