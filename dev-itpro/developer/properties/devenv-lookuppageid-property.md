> **Version**: _Available or changed with runtime version 1.0._

Sets the ID of the page you want to use as a lookup.

## Applies to
-   Table
-   Page Field

[//]: # (IMPORTANT: END>DO_NOT_EDIT)

## Remarks

By default, a lookup provides a list of records in the table. Using this list, users can select a record and retrieve information from it into this control.

> [!NOTE]  
> Consider creating dedicated lookup pages instead of standard pages when adding a lookup (the one that looks like a dropdown) from a field. Default list pages run all triggers and fact boxes even if they aren't shown in the lookup. For more information see [Writing efficient pages](../../performance/performance-developer.md#writing-efficient-pages).
