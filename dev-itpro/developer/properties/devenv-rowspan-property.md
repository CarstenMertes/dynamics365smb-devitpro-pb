[//]: # (IMPORTANT: END>DO_NOT_EDIT)


## Property Values

 An integer that specifies the number of rows to span the field.  
  
## Remarks

When you set a field to span several rows, then the field occupies the cells in the rows below it and existing fields in the occupied cells are moved to the right. 
<!--  //NAV For example, the following illustration shows a GridLayout control that consists of four fields arranged in two rows.  
  
![GridLayout of 4 fields in 2 rows and 2 columns.](../media/NAVGridLayout2rX2c.png "NAVGridLayout2rX2c")  
  
If you set Field 1 to span two rows, then the following layout is displayed:  
  
![GridLayout showing row span.](../media/NAVGridLayoutRowSpan.png "NAVGridLayoutRowSpan")  
 
-->

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The RowSpan property is not supported by the [!INCLUDE[nav_web](../includes/nav_web_md.md)]. If the page displays in the [!INCLUDE[nav_web](../includes/nav_web_md.md)], then the property is ignored and the field will not span any rows.
