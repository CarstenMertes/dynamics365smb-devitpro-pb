> **Version**: _Available or changed with runtime version 1.0._

HorizontalShrink specifies that the control add-in can be made smaller horizontally. This setting is optional.

## Applies to
-   Control Add In

[//]: # (IMPORTANT: END>DO_NOT_EDIT)

## Property Values

**True** if the control add-in is allowed to shrink horizontally. The default value is **false**.

## Remarks

HorizontalShrink is typically used together with the [MinimumWidth](devenv-minimumwidth-property.md) property. If HorizontalShrink is **true** but [MinimumWidth](devenv-minimumwidth-property.md) is not set, the control add-in can shrink to nothing.
When the add-in shrinks in size, the visual content must remain visible and accessible to users. To provide the best experience, consider implementing a responsive design that can adapt to reduced space and horizontal scrollbars.

## Example

```AL
RequestedWidth = 600;
HorizontalShrink = true;
MinimumWidth = 100;
```
