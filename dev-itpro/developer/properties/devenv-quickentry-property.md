# QuickEntry Property
> **Version**: _Available or changed with runtime version 1.0._

Specifies if the page control should have input focus. The default value of the property is true. To specify that a control can be skipped, change this value to false.

Specifying an expression as the value of the property is not supported.

## Applies to
-   Page Field

[//]: # (IMPORTANT: END>DO_NOT_EDIT)


## Property Value
 
**true** specifies that the field has input focus when users move through fields by selecting <kbd>Enter</kbd>; **false** specifies the field to be skipped. The default is **true**.


> [!NOTE]  
> For [!INCLUDE[nav_windows_md](../includes/nav_windows_md.md)] development, you can use a Boolean variable or a Boolean type field on the page to enable quick entry on a field conditionally. The Boolean field on the page can be either a true/false Boolean or a Boolean expression, such as "Credit Limit > Sales YTD". This is currently not supported in the [!INCLUDE[webclient](../includes/webclient.md)]. 

## Remarks  

This property helps accelerate data entry, when using the keyboard, by only focusing on those fields a user typically fills in; skipping those that are rarely filled in. The **QuickEntry** property is respected when users select the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key. This behavior differs from using the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key, which will sequentially give input focus to all page controls. By using this property, you define a path for entering data, which is beneficial for repetitive data entry tasks.

As a developer, the **QuickEntry** property can also be set by Use Designer (see [Use Designer](../devenv-inclient-designer.md)). In the client, users can change the setting for their workspace by using personalization (see [Personalizing Your Workspace](/dynamics365/business-central/ui-personalization-user)).

## Example 1

This example illustrates how to remove the **Credit Limit (LCY)** field from quick entry.

```AL
pageextension 50100 CustomerCardExt extends "Customer Card"
{
    layout
    {
        modify("Credit Limit (LCY)")
        {
            QuickEntry = false;
        }

    }
```

## Example 2

This example illustrates how to dynamically set the **QuickEntry** property in the [!INCLUDE[nav_windows_md](../includes/nav_windows_md.md)] by using a Boolean field on the page. The code modifies the **Customer Card** page so that the **Credit Limit (LCY)** field is skipped if the **Allow Invoice Discount** field is not selected.

```AL
pageextension 50100 CustomerCardExt extends "Customer Card"
{
    layout
    {
        modify("Credit Limit (LCY)")
        {
            QuickEntry = "Allow Line Disc.";
        }

    }
```

Now, when a user enables **Allow Invoice Disc.** on the customer card, the **Credit Limit (LCY)** field gets focus when the user presses Enter. Without this modification, focus skips over the field when the user presses Enter.
