# AutoIncrement Property
> **Version**: _Available or changed with runtime version 1.0._

Sets whether the field value should be automatically incremented.

## Applies to
-   Table Field

[//]: # (IMPORTANT: END>DO_NOT_EDIT)

The fields must be of [Integer Data Type](../methods-auto/library.md) and [BigInteger Data Type](../methods-auto/library.md).

## Property Value  

**True** if the field value is automatically incremented; otherwise, **false**. The default value is **false**.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
> If you want to manually assign a value to a field that has the AutoIncrement property set to **true**, you must be member of the SQL Server db_owner database permission set.  

## Syntax

```AL
field(4; D; Integer) { AutoIncrement = true; }
```

## Remarks  
A table can only contain one auto-increment field. The numbers assigned to this field will not always be consecutive for the following reasons:  
  
- If you delete some records from a table, the numbers used for these records are not reused.  
  
- If several transactions are performed at the same time, they will each be assigned a different number. However, if one of these transactions is rolled back, the number that it was assigned is not reused.  
  
If you add an auto-increment field to an existing table, the field automatically generates consecutive values and inserts them into the table. If you enable the AutoIncrement property for a field that already contains data, there must be no zero values in the field.  
  
The AutoIncrement property is designed to always assign numbers automatically. If you want to insert a record, be sure that the value in this field is blank before you insert the record.  
  
The AutoIncrement property does not work with [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long_md](../includes/d365fin_long_md.md)] temporary tables.
