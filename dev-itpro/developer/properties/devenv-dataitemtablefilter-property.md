# DataItemTableFilter Property
> **Version**: _Available or changed with runtime version 1.0._

Sets filters on fields of the underlying table of a query.

## Applies to
-   Query Data Item

[//]: # (IMPORTANT: END>DO_NOT_EDIT)

## Property Value  

Filter expression.  
  
The filter expression must follow the required syntax. For more information, see [Entering Criteria in Filters](../devenv-entering-criteria-in-filters.md).  

## Syntax

```AL
DataItemTableFilter = "Document Type" = filter (Invoice | "Credit Memo");
```

## Remarks

In a query, a DataItem specifies a table from which to retrieve data. You use the DataItemTableFilter property to apply conditions on one or more fields of the table to limit the records in the resulting dataset of the query. You can filter on any field in the table, not just those fields that are included as columns in the resulting dataset.  
  
In addition to the **DataItemTableFilter** property, you can also filter on the same field by setting the [ColumnFilter Property](devenv-columnfilter-property.md) on a column or filter row or by calling the [SetFilter Method (Query)](../methods-auto/library.md) and [SetRange Method (Query\)](../methods-auto/library.md) from AL. A filter that is set by the ColumnFilter property, **SetFilter** method, or **SetRange** method is joined to the filter that is set by the DataItemTableFilter property. In logical terms, and in SQL SELECT statements, this combination corresponds to an "AND" operator. For example, if the DataItemTableFilter property sets a filter on a field to include values less than fifty \(\<50\) and the **ColumnFilter** property sets a filter on the same field to include values greater than twenty \(>20\), then the resultant filter includes values that are greater than twenty and less than fifty \(20\< value \<50\). Using the same example, if the **SetFilter** method is called from AL code and sets a filter to include values greater than ten \(>10\), then the **SetFilter** method overwrites the **ColumnFilter** property and the resultant filter on the field includes values that are greater than ten and less than fifty \(10\< value \<50\). 

> [!NOTE]  
> In an SQL SELECT statement, a filter that is set by the DataItemTableFilter property would correspond to a WHERE clause.

## Example  

The following example shows how to use the **DataItemTableFilter** property to filter the data of the `Item` table, used in the `"Low on stock inventory items"` query.

The **DataItemTableFilter** property filters on those records that are physical inventory items (`Type = CONST(Inventory)`), that have less than 20 units in stock (`Inventory = filter(<= 20)`) and for which no substitute item exists (`"Substitutes Exist" = const(false)`).

```AL
query 50001 "Low on stock inventory items"
{
    elements
    {
        dataitem(item; "Item")
        {
            DataItemTableFilter = Type = CONST(Inventory), Inventory = FILTER(<= 20),
            "Substitutes Exist" = CONST(False);

            column(Item_No; "Item No.")
            {
            }
            column(Description; Description)
            {
            }
        }
    }
}
```
