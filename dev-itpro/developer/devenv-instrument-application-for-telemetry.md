# Instrumenting an application with telemetry

This article describes how you can implement telemetry signals in your application for emitting telemetry data. This data can then be collected and visualized for analyzing the application against the desired business goals, troubleshooting, and more.

## Event logging vs. Telemetry

One aspect of *event logging* is the data collection about the working and deployment infrastructure of an application to diagnose conditions and troubleshoot problems that affect its operation and performance. For example, this type of event logging includes [!INCLUDE[server](includes/server.md)] events and events from SQL Server. For on-premises installations, the Windows event log has traditionally been the place where such data was logged and analyzed.

A newer aspect of logging is *telemetry*, which is the collection of data about how your application works in production. Telemetry can tell you about specific activities that users perform within the application in the production environment. Telemetry also helps troubleshooting in those situations where you aren't able to reproduce the conditions experienced by the user or have no access to the user's environment. Telemetry can be divided into different categories, like: telemetry for usage, telemetry for errors, telemetry for performance, and telemetry for lifecycle events.

## Resources where telemetry can be logged

There are two different resources where log data can be sent for monitoring and analyzing: 
- Event Log (only for on-premises), and
- Microsoft [!INCLUDE[appinsights](../includes/azure-appinsights-name.md)] (both for on-premises and for online). 

By default, the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] server and application is instrumented to emit several system telemetry events to these destinations. Custom telemetry events enable you to send telemetry data from anywhere in the application code to either of these destinations.

The procedure for creating custom telemetry signals is different for each type of resource. Your choice might also depend on whether you're developing for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] online or on-premises.

|Resource|Description|Online|On-premises|More information|

> [!NOTE]
> Using [!INCLUDE[appinsights](../includes/azure-appinsights-name.md)] is recommended. 

## Using telemetry in your apps/extensions
