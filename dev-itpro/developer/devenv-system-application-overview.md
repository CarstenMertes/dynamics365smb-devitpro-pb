# Overview of the System Application

[!INCLUDE[azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id](~/../shared-content/shared/azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id.md)]

The System Application contains modules that interact with the [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long_md](includes/d365fin_long_md.md)] platform and online ecosystem to support the business logic in the Base Application. If you're developing extensions or add-ons for [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long_md](includes/d365fin_long_md.md)], you'll probably need to use one or more of the objects in the modules.

This article provides an overview of the modules in the System Application.

For an overview of system and application reference documentation, see [System and Base Application Reference for Dynamics 365 Business Central](/dynamics365/business-central/application).

> [!Note]
> The modules in the System Application represent a significant change in what's happening under the hood in [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long_md](includes/d365fin_long_md.md)]. We are aware that the changes we have made will introduce breaking changes, so we have made a list of those that we know about, which includes suggestions for solutions. To view the breaking changes list, see [Breaking Changes](https://github.com/microsoft/ALAppExtensions/blob/master/BREAKINGCHANGES.md).<br><br>We will continue to enhance the System Application in future releases. If you find something you think we should add, visit our [Dynamics 365 Application Ideas](https://aka.ms/bcideas) page. If you want us to improve something, go to the [BCApps](https://github.com/microsoft/BCApps) repository and submit a pull request for it.

<!--## Example - Enhancing a Module


FREDDYK: THIS IS NO LONGER THE WAY TO DO THIS


This example shows how to...

1. Start by pulling the latest Docker image. For more information, see [Freddy's Blog](https://freddysblog.com/2019/07/31/preview-of-dynamics-365-business-central-2019-release-wave-2/).

```
docker pull bcprivate.azurecr.io/bcsandbox-master:base-ltsc2019
```

2. Create a Docker container using your favorite PowerShell script. Be sure to add the useCleanDatabase parameter. For example:

```
$credential = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential -argumentList "admin", (ConvertTo-SecureString -String "P@ssword1" -AsPlainText -Force)
$imageName = "bcprivate.azurecr.io/bcsandbox-master:base-ltsc2019"
$licensePath = "C:\..\l.flf" #put actual path to your license
$containerName = "BC"

New-BCContainer -accept_eula `

                -updateHosts `

                -containerName $containerName `

                -auth NavUserPassword -Credential $credential `

                -imageName  $imageName `

                -licenseFile $licensePath `

                -doNotExportObjectsToText `

                -includeAL `

                -useCleanDatabase `

                -memoryLimit 16g `
```

  > [!Note]
  > The container will start as a process, and the output will display in the PowerShell output window. Make a note of the URL for the web client. You will need that later.

3. Uninstall and unpublish the System Application.

```
UnPublish-BCContainerApp -containerName $containerName `

  -appName "System Application" `

  -unInstall `

  -doNotSaveData
```

4. In Visual Studio Code, run the **AL:Go!** command to create a new AL Project, and then choose **4.0** as the **Target Platform**.

  > [!Note]  
  > The alProjectFolder must be in a location that is shared with the container. For example, a folder in C:\ProgramData\BCContainerHelper will work.

5. When your project is created, follow these steps:

    1. Update launch.json – Update the **Server** and **Server Instance** parameters with values from the PowerShell output.
    2. Delete the **HelloWorld.al** and **app.json** files.

6. Get the latest code for the System Application from our GitHub repository at [BCApps](https://github.com/microsoft/BCApps). In GitHub, choose the **Clone** or **Download** buttons, and then **Download ZIP**. Open the downloaded archive and copy the content of the \BCApps-main\src\System Application\App folder to your AL project.

You now have the latest version of the System Application, and you can download symbols and make enhancements. When you're done, package the System Application without publishing it.

7. Switch back to PowerShell and run the following cmdlet to publish and install a new version of the app:

```
Publish-BCContainerApp -containerName $containerName `

-appFile "C:\ProgramData\BCContainerHelper\AL\DemoSolution\Microsoft_System Application_15.0.0.0.app" `

-skipVerification `

-sync `

-syncMode ForceSync `

-install
```
8. You can share your enhancements with others. For more information, see [Git Going with Extensions](https://community.dynamics.com/business/b/businesscentraldevitpro/posts/quot-git-quot-going-with-extensions). The only difference in the guidance is that you must use a container instead of a cloud sandbox.  -->
