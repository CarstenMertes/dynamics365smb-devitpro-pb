# Event types

[!INCLUDE[d365fin_long_md](includes/d365fin_long_md.md)] supports different types of events for different purposes.

##  <a name="BusinessEvents"></a> Business events

A business event is a custom event that is raised by AL code. It defines a formal contract that carries an implicit promise not to change in future releases. It is the expectation that business events are published by solution ISVs, including Microsoft.

Business events can be compared with publicly released APIs on which 3rd party solution providers develop integrations and additions. Therefore, the downstream cost of making changes to a business event implementation can be considerable for those who use the event in their applications. There may be some cases where changes are required; however, you should keep these to an absolute minimum.

### Development considerations

A typical business event reflects changes in “state” with regards to a process. This makes them very well suited for workflow. An example of a business event could be when a sales order has been posted. It is important to note that business events should not be tied to the implementation-details, such as the tables or fields in which the data is stored. Preferably, the event publisher developer should be free to change the implementation, while still keeping the business event intact. To learn about the syntax and example on how to use the BusinessEvent type, see [BusinessEvent Attribute](attributes/devenv-businessevent-attribute.md).

Business events should be documented with the solution, including the before-state and after-state of the events.

##  <a name="IntegrationEvents"></a> Integration events

An integration event is also a custom event that is raised by AL code, like a business event, except that it does not carry the same promise of not changing, nor does it have the restriction not to expose implementation details.

The main purpose of integration events is to enable the integration of other solutions with [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long_md](includes/d365fin_long_md.md)] without having to perform traditional code modifications.

### Development considerations

An integration event can be changed to a business event later. At which time, it must adhere to the same implied contract and commitment as any business event. It can also simply be designed-in hook points for external add-ons. To learn about the syntax and example on how to use the IntegrationEvent type, see [IntegrationEvent Attribute](attributes/devenv-integrationevent-attribute.md).

## Global events

Global events are predefined system events that are automatically raised by various base application codeunits. For example, codeunit 40 **LoginManagement** includes several global method triggers, such as CompanyOpen, CompanyClose, and GetSystemIndicator. For most of these global method triggers, there are one or two global events: a before and after event. For example, there is an OnBeforeCompanyOpen event and an OnAfterCompanyOpen event. The global events are defined as integration event publishers by local methods in the following codeunits.

|Codeunit ID|Codeunit Name|Event|
|-----------|-------------|-----|
|9170|Conf./Personalization Mgt.|OnRoleCenterOpen|
|||OnAfterLogInEnd|
|||OnBeforeLogInStart|
|||OnBeforeCompanyOpen|
|||OnAfterCompanyOpen|
|||OnBeforeCompanyClose|
|||OnAfterCompanyClose|
|42|TextManagement|OnBeforeMakeTextFilter|
|||OnAfterMakeDateTimeFilter|
|||OnAfterMakeDateFilter|
|||OnAfterMakeTextFilter|
|||OnAfterMakeTimeFilter|
|42*|Caption Class|OnAfterCaptionClassResolve|
|||OnResolveCaptionClass|
|44|ReportManagement|OnAfterGetPrinterName|
|||[OnAfterDocumentPrintReady](devenv-onafterdocumentprintready-event.md)|
|||OnAfterGetPaperTrayForReport|
|||OnAfterGetPrinterName|
|||OnAfterHasCustomLayout|
|||[OnAfterDocumentReady](devenv-onafterdocumentready-event.md)|
|||[OnAfterIntermediateDocumentReady](devenv-onafterintermediatedocumentready-event.md)|
|||[OnAfterDocumentDownload](devenv-onafterdocumentready-event.md)|
|||[OnAfterSetupPrinters](devenv-onaftersetupprinters-event.md)|
|||[OnCustomDocumentMergerex](devenv-oncustomdocumentmergerex-event.md)|
|||OnAfterSubstituteReport|
|45|AutoFormatManagement|OnAfterAutoFormatTranslate|
|49|GlobalTriggerManagement|OnAfterGetGlobalTableTriggerMask|
|||OnAfterOnGlobalInsert|
|||OnAfterOnGlobalModify|
|||OnAfterOnGlobalDelete|
|||OnAfterOnGlobalRename|
|||OnAfterGetDatabaseTableTriggerSetup|
|||OnAfterOnDatabaseInsert|
|||OnAfterOnDatabaseModify|
|||OnAfterOnDatabaseDelete|
|||OnAfterOnDatabaseRename|
|||OnBeforeOnDatabaseInsert|
|||OnBeforeOnDatabaseModify|
|||OnBeforeOnDatabaseDelete|
|||OnBeforeOnDatabaseRename|

\* Codunit 42 **Caption Class** was introduced as a replacement for codeunit 42 **CaptionManagement**.  In previous versions, codeunit 42 **CaptionManagement** included the `OnAfterCaptionClassTranslate` event. For more information, see [Breaking Changes](https://github.com/microsoft/ALAppExtensions/blob/master/BREAKINGCHANGES.md#caption-class-module) in the legacy ALAppExtensions GitHub repo.

## Trigger events

Unlike business and integration events which must be programmed, trigger events are predefined events. Trigger events are published by the runtime and they cannot be raised programmatically. There are two types of trigger events: database trigger events and page trigger events.

> [!NOTE]  
> Trigger events do not appear as methods in AL for a table or page object.

###  <a name="DatabaseEvents"></a> Database trigger events

Trigger events are automatically raised by the system when it performs database operations on a table object, such as deleting, inserting, modifying, and renaming a record, as defined in a table. Trigger events are closely associated with the table triggers for database operations: OnDelete, OnInsert, OnModify, OnRename, and OnValidate \(for fields\). For each database operation, there is a "before" and "after" trigger event with a fixed signature.

**Available Database Trigger Events**

The following table describes the available database trigger events:

|Database trigger event|Signature|Description|
|----------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
|[OnAfterDeleteEvent Trigger Event](triggers-auto/events/table/devenv-onafterdeleteevent-table-trigger.md)|`[EventSubscriber(ObjectType::Table, Database::<Table Name>, 'OnAfterDeleteEvent', '', <SkipOnMissingLicense>, <SkipOnMissingPermission>)]`<br />`local procedure MyProcedure(var Rec: Record; RunTrigger: Boolean)` | Executed after a record is deleted from a table.|

The following table describes the parameters of the trigger events:

|Parameter|Type|Description|
|---------------|----------|-----------------|
|*Rec*|Record|The table that raises the event.|
|*xRec*|Record|The table that raises the event.|
|*RunTrigger*|Boolean|Specifies whether to execute the code in the event trigger when it is invoked. If this parameter is true, the code will be executed. If this parameter is false, then the code is not executed.|
|*CurrFieldNo*|Integer|The number of the field that raises the event.|

#### Order of event execution

The relative order of execution of database trigger events, table triggers, and database operations is as follows:

|Order|Item|Example|
|-----------|----------|-------------|
|1|Trigger event \(before\)|OnBeforeDeleteEvent|
|2|Table trigger|OnDelete|
|3|Global table trigger in codeunit|OnDatabaseDelete|
|4|Database operations|Delete the record|
|5|Trigger event \(after\)|OnAfterDeleteEvent|

###  <a name="PageEvents"></a> Page trigger events

Page Trigger events are raised automatically by the system when it performs certain operations in a page object. Page trigger events are closely associated with the standard page triggers, such as OnOpenPage, OnClosePage, and OnAction.

#### Available page trigger events
