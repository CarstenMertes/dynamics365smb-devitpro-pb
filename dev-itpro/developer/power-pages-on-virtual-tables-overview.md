# Power Pages on virtual tables (preview)

[!INCLUDE[public_preview_disclaimer](includes/public_preview_disclaimer.md)]

Data virtualization is part of the fabric or tools to integrate Business Central online with Microsoft Dataverse. To learn more about Dataverse integration, consult [Business Central & Dataverse integration](https://github.com/microsoft/d365bcdv/blob/main/Review%20of%20Business%20Central%20and%20Dataverse%20integration.pdf). Data virtualization allows users with Business Central licenses and entitlements to access data stored in Business Central online by performing (**C**reate/**R**ead/**U**pdate/**D**elete) API operations on Business Central tables that are available as virtual tables in Dataverse.  

![Diagram of the interactions between Dataverse and Business Central](media/virtual-table-inbound-interaction.png)

These licensed users are considered as internal users to the organizations or companies that purchase the licenses. They're in employee-like relationships with the companies and perform business processes on the companies' behalf. They can access data stored in Business Central online using Power Apps and Power Automate, which operate on virtual tables in Dataverse.

Business Central 2023 release wave 2, version 23.1, introduced Power Pages on virtual tables feature. This feature allows unlicensed external users to access data stored in Business Central online by using Power Pages that operates on virtual tables in Dataverse.  For more info on internal and  external users, consult the [Dynamics 365 licensing guide](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=866544&clcid=0x409) and refer to the **Licensing requirements for external users** and **Multiplexing** sections.

External users are typically users from the customer or vendor organizations of companies that purchase Business Central licenses.  In some commerce or collaboration scenarios, these users might need to participate in processes that involve data stored in Business Central online, such as customer onboarding, vendor bidding, and so on&mdash;even if they arenâ€™t Business Central users. This new feature enables those companies to build business-to-business (B2B) portals using Power Pages that serve their customers and vendors, so external users can have anonymous and authenticated access to data stored in Business Central online.  

Anonymous access via Power Pages allows external users to perform API operations on Business Central tables without signing in. Authenticated access via Power Pages requires external users to sign in to perform API operations on Business Central tables or rows that are accessible to them. Business Central admins can select only the necessary API operations, tables, and rows to be enabled for anonymous and authenticated access by external users. Additionally, this feature also enables authenticated access via Power Pages for internal and existing Business Central users, similar to authenticated access via Power Apps and Power Automate. 

This article highlights the new feature of Power Pages on virtual tables, the prerequisites and step-by-step instructions to preview it, its current limitations, and future improvements.

## <a name="s2s"></a>Assign permission sets to anonymous and authenticated external users

Because external users have no Business Central license or entitlements, we included built-in app/S2S users to access data stored in Business Central online on their behalf. Permission sets can be assigned to these app/S2S users to control data access by external users. To do so, complete the following steps:

1. In [Business Central](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/), search for and open the **Microsoft Entra Applications** page.

   There are three built-in app/S2S users:
   
   - **Dynamics 365 Business Central for Virtual Tables** for accessing data stored in Business Central online via Power Apps, Power Automate, and Power Pages by personifying authenticated internal users.
   - **Power Pages Anonymous External Users** for accessing data stored in Business Central online via Power Pages on behalf of anonymous external users.
   - **Power Pages Authenticated External Users** for accessing data stored in Business Central online via Power Pages on behalf of authenticated external users.

   ![Screenshot of the Microsoft Entra Applications page in Business Central](media/power-pages-microsoft-entra-applications.png)

1. Open the **Power Pages Anonymous External Users** card, set the **State** field to **Enabled**, and assign permission sets with the appropriate scope for anonymous external users, for example read-only for certain tables and LOGIN permission set as a minimum.

   ![Screenshot of the Power Pages Anonymous External Users card in Business Central](media/power-pages-microsoft-entra-application-for-anonymous-access.png)

1. Open the **Power Pages Authenticated External Users** card, set the **State** field to **Enabled**, and assign permission sets with the appropriate scope for authenticated external users, for example read-write for certain tables and LOGIN permission set as a minimum.

   ![Screenshot of the Power Pages Authenticated External Users card in Business Central](media/power-pages-microsoft-entra-application-for-authenticated-access.png)

## <a name="visible"></a>Make virtual Business Central tables visible on Dataverse

To make virtual Business Central tables visible on Dataverse, complete the following steps:

1. In [Power Apps maker portal](https://make.powerapps.com/), select the **Apps** section, and launch the **Business Central Configuration** app.

   ![Screenshot of the Business Central Configuration app](media/power-apps-business-central-configuration.png)

1. In the **Business Central Configuration** app, complete the following steps:

   1. Select the **Available Tables** section.
   2. Select the virtual Business Central tables to be made visible, such as **Customer**, **Item**, **Sales Order**, **Sales Invoice**, **Sales Shipment**, and **Vendor** tables.
   3. Select **Edit**.
   3. Select the **Visible** check box, and then select **Save**.

   ![Screenshot of the Available Tables section in Business Central Configuration app](media/power-apps-business-central-configuration-available-tables.png)
 
## <a name="lookup"></a>Add lookup columns on Dataverse Contact table

Because Power Pages authentication is linked to Dataverse **Contact** table, external users who sign in as contacts from customer or vendor organizations should only access their customer-specific or vendor-specific data. You can set up this behavior by first adding lookup columns on Dataverse **Contact** table to the virtual Business Central **Customer** or **Vendor** tables.  To do so, complete the following steps:

1. In [Power Apps maker portal](https://make.powerapps.com/), select the **Tables** section, **Contact** table, **Columns** icon, and then select **+ New column**.
1. Enter a descriptive display name for the lookup column, for example, *BC Customer* or *BC Vendor*.
1. Set the **Data type** field to **Lookup**, **Related table** field to **Customer** or **Vendor**, and then select **Save**.

   ![Screenshot of adding a column in Power Apps maker portal](media/power-apps-contact-table-add-lookup-columns.png)

## <a name="synthetic"></a>Create synthetic relations for Dataverse Contact table

Because Power Pages authentication is linked to Dataverse **Contact** table, external users who sign in as contacts from customer or vendor organizations should only access their customer-specific or vendor-specific data. Only rows in virtual Business Central tables that are associated with the signed-in contacts should be shown. You can set up this behavior by creating synthetic relations between the native Dataverse **Contact** table and virtual Business Central tables, such as **Sales Order**, **Sales Invoice**, and **Sales Shipment** tables. To do so, complete the following steps:

1. In [Power Apps maker portal](https://make.powerapps.com/), add lookup columns on Dataverse **Contact** table. To learn more, go to [Add lookup columns on Dataverse Contact table](#lookup).
1. Select the **Tables** section, **Contact** table, **Keys** icon, and then select **+ New key**.
1. Enter a descriptive display name for your key, for example *bccustomerkey* or *bcvendorkey*.
1. Select *BC Customer* or *BC Vendor* in the **Columns** fields, and then select **Save**.

   If multiple contacts are associated with one customer or vendor, you can select more columns, such as **Business Phone** or **Email**, to show only rows in virtual Business Central tables that are associated with the specific signed-in contacts.

   ![Screenshot of adding a key in Power Apps maker portal](media/power-apps-contact-table-add-keys.png)

1. Select the **Apps** section, and launch the **Business Central Configuration** app.

   ![Screenshot of the Business Central Configuration app](media/power-apps-business-central-configuration.png)

1. In the **Business Central Configuration** app, select the **Table Relations** section, and then select **+ New**.
1. On the **General** tab, enter the appropriate field values.  For example, to create a synthetic relation between the native Dataverse **Contact** table and virtual Business Central **Sales Order** table, fill in the fields as follows:

   - a descriptive display name, like *dyn365bc_contact2salesorder*, for the **Relation Name** field
   - *contact* for the **Native Table** field
   - the schema name of your key, like *cr7b3_bccustomerkey*, for the **Native Table Key** field
   - *dyn365bc_salesorder_v2_0* for the **Virtual Table** field

   ![Screenshot of the Table Relations General tab in Business Central Configuration app](media/power-apps-business-central-configuration-table-relations-general.png)

1. On the **Mappings** tab, enter the schema names of **Native columns** that map to those of **Virtual columns**. For example, *cr7b3_bccustomer* that maps to *dyn365bc_customer_customerid*.

   ![Screenshot of the Table Relations Mappings tab in Business Central Configuration app](media/power-apps-business-central-configuration-table-relations-mappings.png)
