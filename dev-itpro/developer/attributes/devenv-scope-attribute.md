For more information, see [Compilation Scope Overview](../devenv-compilation-scope-overview.md).

## Example

Setting the attribute on a method. Each method must be explicitly marked with `[Scope('OnPrem')]` because default is `[Scope('Cloud')]`.

```AL
procedure MyProcedureForCloud()
    begin
        Message('My procedure is available in cloud, but cannot call any onprem method.');
    end;

[Scope('OnPrem')]
procedure MyProcedureForOnPrem()
    begin
        Message('My procedure is not available to a cloud extension.');
    end;

```
