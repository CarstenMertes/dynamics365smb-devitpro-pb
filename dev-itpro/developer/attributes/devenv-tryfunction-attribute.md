# TryFunction Attribute

Specifies the method to be a try method, which can be used to catch and handle errors and exceptions that occur when code is run.


## Applies To

## Syntax


> **Version**: _Available or changed with runtime version 2.0._
```AL
[TryFunction]
procedure TryFunction()
```

## Remarks

> [!NOTE]  
> In test and upgrade codeunits, this property only applies to normal methods as specified by the [Normal Attribute \(Test Codeunits\)](devenv-normal-attribute.md) or [MethodType Property \(Upgrade Codeunits\)](../devenv-methodtype-property-upgrade-codeunits.md).  

Try methods in AL enable you to handle errors that occur in the application during code execution. For example, with try methods, you can provide more user-friendly error messages to the end user than those thrown by the system. You can use try methods to catch errors/exceptions that are thrown by [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] or exceptions that are thrown during .NET Framework interoperability operations.  

For more information, see [Handling Errors by Using Try Methods](../devenv-handling-errors-using-try-methods.md).  

## Example

The `IsSecureHttpUrl` method throws an error when trying to make a web request using an insecure URL. By setting the **TryFunction** attribute on it, the exception can be caught and handled by the `OnRun` trigger.

```al
[TryFunction]
procedure IsSecureHttpUrl(Url: Text)
var
    Uri: DotNet Uri;
begin
    IsValidUri(Url);
    Uri := Uri.Uri(Url);
    if Uri.Scheme <> 'https' then
        Error(NonSecureUriErr);
end;
```

```al
trigger OnRun()
var
    URL: Text;
begin
    if not IsSecureHttpUrl(URL) then begin
        message('URL is not secure.')
        exit(true);
    exit(false);
end;
```
