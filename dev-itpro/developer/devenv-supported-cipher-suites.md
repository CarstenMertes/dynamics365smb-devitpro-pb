# Supported cipher suites in outgoing calls

This article lists the cipher suites that are supported on external APIs that are called from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online.

## Overview

For [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to connect to an external API, the API's web site must use an HTTPS certificate. In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], the certificate must be added to [HttpClient](methods-auto/httpclient/httpclient-data-type.md) instance that will send HTTP requests to and receive HTTP responses from external API. The certificate must use one of supported cipher suites; otherwise, the outgoing web service call will fail with security exception.

A cipher suite is used to help secure web service calls made from the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app to an external URL. A cipher suite is a set of algorithms, which typically include:  key exchange, authentication, encryption, and message authentication code (MAC).

## Supported cipher suites in HTTPS certificate
