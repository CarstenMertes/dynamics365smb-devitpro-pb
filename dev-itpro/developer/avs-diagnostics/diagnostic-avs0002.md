# AVS Error AVS0002

[!INCLUDE[banner_preview](../includes/banner_preview.md)]

The runtime version '{0}' of the extension is too recent for the release of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] being validated. The latest supported runtime version is '{1}'.

## How to fix this diagnostic?

In the app.json file of the app you must specify the latest supported runtime version or lower. For more information, see [app.json file](../devenv-json-files.md#appjson-file) and [Choosing Runtime Version in AL](../devenv-choosing-runtime.md).
