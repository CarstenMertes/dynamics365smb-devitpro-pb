# AVS Error AVS0109

[!INCLUDE[banner_preview](../includes/banner_preview.md)]

The per-tenant extension (or one of its dependencies) cannot be deployed as it has missing dependencies or the dependencies are conflicting with currently installed apps. Check if these dependencies are installed.

## Remarks

A common reason for this error is that a build already has been published directly from Visual Studio Code in DEV scope.
