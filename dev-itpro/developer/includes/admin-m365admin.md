Because you're signed in as the administrator of the demonstration tenant, you can access the Microsoft 365 administration center. The following list illustrates the types of work that your demo account can do:

* Subscribe to more apps and services that might be relevant to your demos  

* Configure apps and services by accessing their administration centers  

* Modify or add user accounts, and assign licenses  

* Set up the organizational profile to reflect your prospect's business and brand  

Your administrator account also gives you access to the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](prod_short.md)] administration center, where you can make further customizations, such as:

* Create extra environments within the available quota, depending on your needs.  

    For example, you can create a [!INCLUDE [prod_short](prod_short.md)] environment for a specific country/region, or create a dedicated sandbox that you then apply your solution to, such as by deploying your app straight from Visual Studio Code.   

    Learn more in [Managing Environments](../../administration/tenant-admin-center-environments.md).  

* Specify the update window and date for your environments, so that planned updates don't interfere with your demos. Learn more in [Set the update window for each environment](../../administration/tenant-admin-center-update-management.md#set-the-update-window-for-each-environment)

* Add your own email address to the list of notification recipients, so that you're informed of upgrades to your [!INCLUDE [prod_short](prod_short.md)] environments or any issues that might affect your planned demos. Learn more in [Manage Tenant-Specific Notifications](../../administration/tenant-admin-center-notifications.md)

* Try out new functionality in preview environments that are available about two months before a major update. For more information, see [Prepare for major updates with preview environments](../../administration/preview-environments.md).  

With your administrator account, you can install apps from AppSource, and you can set up integrations between [!INCLUDE [prod_short](prod_short.md)] and other services. For example, you can add the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](prod_short.md)] app for Microsoft Teams, and you can run the **Set up your Business Inbox in Outlook** assisted setup guide on behalf of the organization as described in the [Use [!INCLUDE [prod_short](prod_short.md)] as your Business Inbox in Outlook](/dynamics365/business-central/admin-outlook) article. You can also add [Dynamics 365 Customer Service](/dynamics365/customer-service/index), [Dynamics 365 Sales](/dynamics365/sales-enterprise/overview), [Power Automate](/power-automate/), [Power Apps](/powerapps/), and many more.  

Some content packs provide more demonstration data for non-administrator accounts, such as example channels and conversations in Microsoft Teams that can reduce the time needed to customize the experience for a demo. You can sign in with the demo user account for the non-administrator experience.
