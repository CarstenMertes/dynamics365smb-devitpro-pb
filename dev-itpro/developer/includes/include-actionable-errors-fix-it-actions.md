**Fix-it actions** are for when the correct value is known. If all the following four statements are true for your error case, then consider adding a recommended Fix-it action in your error message to enable users to easily unblock themselves from the error.

1. Is the solution to the error known?
2. Is the error location on the current page?
3. Can the error (value) be corrected with one action?
4. Does the user have permission to make the required correction?
