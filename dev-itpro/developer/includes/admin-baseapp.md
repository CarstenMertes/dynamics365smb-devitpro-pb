The base application is the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](prod_short.md)] application provided by Microsoft, customized and extended to fit the needs of a market segment that an app wants to serve. Major releases and cumulative updates (CUs) of the base application are publicly available on [Microsoft Download](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4072483) and as artifacts for use with Docker. 

Pre-released versions of the base application are available as artifacts for participants of the “Ready and Go” program via Microsoft Collaborate for use with Docker. Although we recommend always using the latest version of the base application, partners can choose any version they need. The only requirement is that the partner makes sure that the base application version that they are targeting in their app is available in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](prod_short.md)] online production environments.  

AppSource apps must specify the dependency of a specific base application in the settings for their app. In contrast, the base application is an optional part of an [!INCLUDE[embedapp](embedapp.md)] package. If the partner has implemented all required functionality in their library extensions, they do not have to include the base application itself with the [!INCLUDE[embedapp](embedapp.md)]. Instead they should specify, in the metadata of the [!INCLUDE[embedapp](embedapp.md)], which version of the [!INCLUDE[[prod_short](prod_short.md)] base application they are targeting, just like an AppSource app.
