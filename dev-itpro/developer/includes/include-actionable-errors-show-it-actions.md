**Show-it actions** are for when the error location is known. A shortcut can then be provided to show the related page to enable users to easily unblock themselves from the error. If all the following four statements are true for your error case, then consider adding a recommended Show-it action in your error message.

1. Is the solution to the error known?
2. Is the error correction location known and is it on a related table?
3. Can you show the related table with one action?
4. Does the user have permission to make the required correction?
