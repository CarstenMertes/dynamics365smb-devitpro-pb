User access policies and data retention periods after a subscription ends depend on the subscription type that existed on the tenant and the manner in which the subscription ended. These policies are shared across Microsoft's online offerings; learn more about suscription lifecycle states in [Partner Center documentation](/partner-center/subscription-lifecycle) and [Microsoft 365 documentation](/microsoft-365/commerce/subscriptions/what-if-my-subscription-expires?view=o365-worldwide&preserve-view=true).
