There are currently two available ranges that you can request. Both have some characteristics to keep in mind:

- *RSP Object Range* (ID range 1,000,000-69,999,999)

    This object range is tied to [the RSP Program](https://businesscenter.mbs.microsoft.com/#contentdetail/RegisterSolutionProgram) details.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > We currently advise new publishers to *not* request an RSP object range

- *App Object Range* (ID range 70,000,000-74,999,999)

    This object range was originally designed just for apps in the Microsoft commercial marketplace to be used in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](prod_short.md)] online.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > We currently advise new publishers to request an app object range.

Currently, you can implement apps developed in both the *RSP range* and the *app object range* in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](prod_short.md)] online and on-premises, as well as partner-hosted.
