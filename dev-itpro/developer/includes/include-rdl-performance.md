> RDL layouts can result in slower performance with document reports, regarding actions that are related to the user interface (for example. like sending emails) compared to Word layouts. When developing layouts for document reports, we recommend that you design Word layouts instead of RDL. With Word layouts, reports are not impacted by the security constraints on sandbox app domains like they are with RDL layouts. From a service perspective, RDL layouts are not trusted, so they will run in a sandbox app domain that only lives for the current report invocation.
