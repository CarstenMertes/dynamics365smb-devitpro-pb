- Show-it actions are phrased: “Show...”.
  - Such as: “Show User Setup”, “Show Items list” or “Show Item 70062”. 
- Show-it action tooltips are often phrased: “Opens page:..”.
  - Note: Avoid using “Open” for the button label, as it can be confused with opening the status of the document. Instead use “Show” and use the tooltip to write out “Opens Page:...”.
- Captions are capitalized, such as: Item, Direct Posting and G/L Account.
