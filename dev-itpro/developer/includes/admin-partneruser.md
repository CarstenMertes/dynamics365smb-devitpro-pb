[!INCLUDE[azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id](~/../shared-content/shared/azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id.md)]

Quite often, partner users are registered as business-to-business (B2B) guest users in their customer's Microsoft Entra ID, such as to collaborate through Teams. However, when a partner user is added as a guest to their customer's Microsoft Entra ID, they can no longer log in as a delegated admin into the customer's [!INCLUDE [prod_short](prod_short.md)]. These guest users do not have a valid [!INCLUDE [prod_short](prod_short.md)] license assigned to them. But if the partner user has *granular delegated admin privileges*, they can access the customer's [!INCLUDE [prodadmincenter](prodadmincenter.md)] and manage the environments there. Starting in 2022 release wave 2, partner users that are guest users and have granular delegated admin privileges are no longer blocked from accessing [!INCLUDE [prod_short](prod_short.md)]. But we continue to consider it a best practice that customers do not invite partner users to their tenant as guests but ask them to set up granular delegated admin privileges, using the *Dynamics 365 administrator* role.
