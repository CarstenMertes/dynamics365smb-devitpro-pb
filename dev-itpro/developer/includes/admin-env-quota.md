> [!NOTE]
> The Premium and Essential subscription types give each [!INCLUDE[prod_short](prod_short.md)] customer one production environment and three sandbox environment free of extra charge. If the customer requires more production environments, they can buy additional environments through their CSP partner. Each additional production environment comes with three additional sandbox environments and 4 GB additional, tenant-wide database capacity. In addition, starting in 2023 release wave 2, there's a limit on how many companies you can have on a single tenant (see [Operational limits](../../administration/operational-limits-online.md#company-limit-per-environment)).

Administrators can create the additional environments in the [!INCLUDE [prodadmincenter](prodadmincenter.md)]. The environments can be created and used in any country or region where [!INCLUDE[prod_short](prod_short.md)] is available, on any available version. The environments quota is applied when you try to create a new environment, or copy or restore an existing environment, in the [!INCLUDE [prodadmincenter](prodadmincenter.md)].
