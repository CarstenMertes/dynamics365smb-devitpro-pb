You can upgrade to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](prod_short.md)] online from supported versions of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](prod_short.md)] on-premises, as long as extensions handle your application customizations.

The process consists of two parts:

- Convert nonstandard functionality and customizations to apps and per-tenant extensions. Learn more in [Deploying a Tenant Customization](../devenv-deploy-tenant-customization.md).
- Run the cloud migration tool, and then switch to use [!INCLUDE[prod_short](prod_short.md)] online going forward.
