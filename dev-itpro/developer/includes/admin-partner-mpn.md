### Join the Microsoft Partner Network

Microsoft Partner Network (MPN) membership unlocks our best resources to differentiate your business, take your product to market, and sell your solutions. To become a partner, you must join the Microsoft Partner Network (MPN), at which time you will be assigned an MPN ID. MPN membership is free to all partners; you can enroll in the MPN [here](https://partner.microsoft.com/membership).

Once signed up, you will get an MPN ID â€“ your gateway to access all the membership resources and benefits for your partnership with Microsoft. There is no cost to obtain a MPN ID as a Network member, and with options to upgrade to an [Action Pack](https://partner.microsoft.com/membership/action-pack) subscription or work toward a [competency](https://partner.microsoft.com/membership/competencies), you can access even more benefits.  

### Set up your Partner Center account

Once you have joined the Microsoft Partner Network (MPN), you can [set up your Partner Center (PC) account](/partner-center/mpn-create-a-partner-center-account). The Microsoft Partner Center is a generic portal where partners can sell and manage customer subscriptions for Microsoft services, such as Microsoft 365, Azure, Dynamics 365, and others, as well as for some third-party products. For more information, see the [Partner Center documentation](/partner-center/).

Your Partner Center account provides you with access to pricing information, tools and services, and enables you to manage admin credentials for your company's work account. Partner Center is also where you can purchase or renew subscriptions to Microsoft Action Packs, create a business profile to receive and manage sales leads from Microsoft, and see if you qualify for co-selling opportunities.
