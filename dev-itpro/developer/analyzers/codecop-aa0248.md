## Description
Add 'this' qualification to improve readability.

## Remarks

This rule is hidden by default, which means that it appears as three dots in the editor, but doesn't show up as a diagnostic in the **Problems** view in Visual Studio Code or in any pipelines. The CodeCop rule identifies where you can take advantage of using the `this` keyword. Use the [workspace-wide code action](../devenv-code-actions.md) to help you clean up your code.

Learn more about the `this` keyword in [Use the this keyword for codeunit self-reference](../devenv-al-this-keyword.md).
