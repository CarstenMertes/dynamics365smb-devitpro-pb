## Description

[//]: # (IMPORTANT: END>DO_NOT_EDIT)

## Remarks

This error occurs when a table key property is modified in a way that isn't supported. Modifying table key properties can lead to destructive changes, which can break the upgrade process for existing installations and dependent extensions.

## How to fix this diagnostic?

To resolve this error, you need to avoid making unsupported changes to table key properties. Here are the steps:

1. Locate the table key property in your code that is causing the error.
2. Change the property back to its original value or to a supported value.
