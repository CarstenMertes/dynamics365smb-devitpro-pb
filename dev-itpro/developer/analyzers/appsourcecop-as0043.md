# AppSourceCop Error AS0043
The clustered key must not be deleted

## Description
The clustered key must not be deleted.

[//]: # (IMPORTANT: END>DO_NOT_EDIT)

It is not allowed to rename or remove the clustered key in a table. For more information on table keys, see [Table Keys](../devenv-table-keys.md).

> [!NOTE]  
> This rule validates tables independently of their Accessibility or ObsoleteState, because tables are always used when synchronizing the schema defined in the extension to the database.

## How to fix this diagnostic?

In order to fix this diagnostic, you must rename the clustered key or add it back so that it matches its definition in your baseline extension.

## Code examples triggering the rule

Version 1.0 of the extension:

```AL
table 50100 MyTable
{
    fields
    {
        field(1; MyIntegerField; Integer) { }
        field(2; MyTextField; Text[50]) { }
    }

    keys
    {
        key(PK; MyIntegerField) { }

        key(ClusteredKey; MyTextField) 
        { 
            Clustered = true;
        }
    }
}
```

### Example 1 - Removing the clustered key

Version 2.0 of the extension:

```AL
table 50100 MyTable
{
    fields
    {
        field(1; MyIntegerField; Integer) { }
        field(2; MyTextField; Text[50]) { }
    }

    keys
    {
        key(PK; MyIntegerField) { }
    }
}
```

In version 2.0 of the extension, the clustered key `ClusteredKey` has been removed. *This change is not allowed by the synchronization engine*.

### Example 2 - Renaming the clustered key

```AL
table 50100 MyTable
{
    fields
    {
        field(1; MyIntegerField; Integer) { }
        field(2; MyTextField; Text[50]) { }
    }

    keys
    {
        key(PK; MyIntegerField) { }

        key(NewClusteredKey; MyTextField) 
        { 
            Clustered = true;
        }
    }
}
```

In version 2.0 of the extension, the clustered key has been renamed from `ClusteredKey` to `NewClusteredKey`. This change is detected as a removal of `ClusteredKey` and *is not allowed by the synchronization engine*.
