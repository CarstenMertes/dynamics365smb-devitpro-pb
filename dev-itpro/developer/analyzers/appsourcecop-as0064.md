# AppSourceCop Error AS0064
Interface implementations that have been published must not be deleted.

## Description
An interface implementation that has been published must not be deleted, because dependent extensions may break.

[//]: # (IMPORTANT: END>DO_NOT_EDIT)

## Remarks

This error occurs when an attempt is made to delete an interface implementation that has already been published. Deleting a published interface implementation can break dependent extensions that rely on it, leading to runtime errors and loss of functionality.

## How to fix this diagnostic?

To resolve this error, you need to ensure that published interface implementations aren't deleted. Here are the steps:

1. Locate the interface implementation in your code that is being deleted.
2. Restore the interface implementation to its original state.
