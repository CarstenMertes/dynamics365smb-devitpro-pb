# AppSourceCop Error AS0066
A new method to an interface that has been published must not be added.

## Description
A new method to an interface that has been published must not be added, because dependent extensions may break

[//]: # (IMPORTANT: END>DO_NOT_EDIT)

## Remarks

This error occurs when an attempt is made to add a new method to an interface that has already been published. Adding a new method to a published interface can break dependent extensions that rely on it, leading to runtime errors and loss of functionality.

## How to fix this diagnostic?

To resolve this error, you need to ensure that new methods aren't added to a published interface. Here are the steps:

1. Locate the method on the interface in your code that is being added.
2. Restore the interface to its original state.
