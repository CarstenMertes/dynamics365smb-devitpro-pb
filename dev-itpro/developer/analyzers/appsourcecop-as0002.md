# AppSourceCop Error AS0002
Fields must not be deleted.

## Description
Fields must not be deleted. This might break the upgrade of existing installations and dependent extensions.

[//]: # (IMPORTANT: END>DO_NOT_EDIT)

> [!NOTE]  
> This rule validates all fields independently of their Accessibility or ObsoleteState, because they are used when synchronizing the schema defined in the extension to the database.
