Pages and reports should use the UsageCategory and ApplicationArea properties to be searchable.

## Description
Pages and reports should use the UsageCategory and ApplicationArea properties to be searchable.

[//]: # (IMPORTANT: END>DO_NOT_EDIT)

## How to fix this diagnostic?

For a page that should be searchable, set both the [UsageCategory](../properties/devenv-usagecategory-property.md) and [ApplicationArea](../properties/devenv-applicationarea-property.md) properties.

If a page should not be searchable, set the property as follows:

```AL
UsageCategory = None;
```
