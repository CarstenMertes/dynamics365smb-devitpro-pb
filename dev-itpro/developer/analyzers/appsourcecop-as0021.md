# AppSourceCop Error AS0021
An argument in an event attribute cannot be changed to false.

## Description
An argument in an event attribute cannot be changed to false. This is not allowed because it may break dependent extensions that have subscribed to this event.

[//]: # (IMPORTANT: END>DO_NOT_EDIT)

## Remarks
This rule verifies that events that are available from other extensions such as [Business](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/attributes/devenv-businessevent-attribute) type events or [Integration](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/attributes/devenv-integrationevent-attribute) type events do not stop exposing their sender or their global variables.

This does not apply to [Internal](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/attributes/devenv-internalevent-attribute) type events as they are not exposed to dependent extensions.

## Code examples triggering the rule

### Example 1 - A business type event stops exposing its sender

Version 1.0 of the extension:
```AL
codeunit 50100 MyCodeunit
{
    [BusinessEvent(true)]
    procedure MyEvent()
    begin
    end;
}
```

Version 2.0 of the extension:
```AL
codeunit 50100 MyCodeunit
{
    [BusinessEvent(false)]
    procedure MyEvent()
    begin
    end;
}
```

In the newer version, the sender exposed by `MyEvent` is not accessible to subscribers anymore. If a dependent extension relies on it, this will lead to a compilation error similar to `The member referenced by event subscriber 'MyProcedure' parameter 'sender' is not found (AL0282)`.

For example, the following extension compiles when depending on version 1.0, but fails to compile with version 2.0:
```AL
codeunit 50120 AnotherCodeunit
{
    [EventSubscriber(ObjectType::Codeunit, Codeunit::MyCodeunit, 'MyEvent', '', true, true)]
    local procedure MyProcedure(sender: Codeunit MyCodeunit)
    begin
        // Subscriber logic
    end;
}

```

### Example 2 - An integration type event stops exposing global variables

Version 1.0 of the extension:
```AL
codeunit 50100 MyCodeunit
{
    [IntegrationEvent(true, true)]
    procedure MyEvent()
    begin
    end;

    var
        myGlobalVariable: Integer;
}
```

Version 2.0 of the extension:
```AL
codeunit 50100 MyCodeunit
{
    [IntegrationEvent(true, false)]
    procedure MyEvent()
    begin
    end;

    var
        myGlobalVariable: Integer;
}
```

In the newer version, the global variables exposed by `MyEvent` are not accessible to subscribers anymore. If a dependent extension relies on global variables, this will lead to a compilation error similar to `The member referenced by event subscriber 'MyProcedure' parameter 'myGlobalVariable' is not found (AL0282)`.

For example, the following extension compiles when depending on version 1.0, but fails to compile with version 2.0:

```AL
codeunit 50120 AnotherCodeunit
{
    [EventSubscriber(ObjectType::Codeunit, Codeunit::MyCodeunit, 'MyEvent', '', true, true)]
    local procedure MyProcedure(myGlobalVariable: Integer)
    begin
        // Subscriber logic
    end;
}
```

## Code examples not triggering the rule

### Example 1 - An event does not change over time

Version 1.0 of the extension:
```AL
codeunit 50100 MyCodeunit
{
    [BusinessEvent(false)]
    procedure MyEvent()
    begin
    end;
}
```

Version 2.0 of the extension:
```AL
codeunit 50100 MyCodeunit
{
    [BusinessEvent(false)]
    procedure MyEvent()
    begin
    end;
}
```

The event remains the same from one version to the other.

### Example 2 - An event starts exposing its sender

Version 1.0 of the extension:
```AL
codeunit 50100 MyCodeunit
{
    [BusinessEvent(false)]
    procedure MyEvent()
    begin
    end;
}
```

Version 2.0 of the extension:
```AL
codeunit 50100 MyCodeunit
{
    [BusinessEvent(true)]
    procedure MyEvent()
    begin
    end;
}
```

In the newer version of the extension, the sender becomes exposed through the business type event.
