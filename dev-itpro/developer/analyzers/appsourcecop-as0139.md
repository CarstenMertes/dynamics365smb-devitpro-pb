# AppSourceCop Warning AS0139
New table fields must use the AllowInCustomizations property

## Description
New table fields must use the AllowInCustomizations property and its value must be different from ToBeClassified and Always. From runtime 16.0, you can specify on the application object level the AllowInCustomizations to use as default for all its fields.

## Remarks

This rule analyzes only fields that are newly added in the current version, that is, fields that donâ€™t exist in the baseline. It helps you prioritize classification of new fields and tables without requiring you to classify all existing fields.
