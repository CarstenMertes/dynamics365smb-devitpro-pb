# AppSourceCop Warning AS0081
InternalsVisibleTo should not be used as a security feature.

## Description
The InternalsVisibleTo setting will expose your internal objects to any extension with the given name, publisher, and ID. Access modifiers are not designed to be used as a security boundary, but for API development.
