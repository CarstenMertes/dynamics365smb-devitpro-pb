# CodeCop Warning AA0073
The name of temporary variable must be prefixed with Temp.

## Description
Only temporary variable names must be prefixed with Temp.

[//]: # (IMPORTANT: END>DO_NOT_EDIT)

## Reason for the rule
Temporary variables must be named with identifiers that abbreviate the word temporary, such as temp. This improves readability of the code.

## Bad code example
```AL
JobWIPBuffer : Record "Job WIP Buffer" temporary;
```

## Good code example
```AL
TempJobWIPBuffer : Record "Job WIP Buffer" temporary;
```
