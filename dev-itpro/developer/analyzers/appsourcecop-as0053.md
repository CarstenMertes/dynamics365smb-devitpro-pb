The compilation target of an application must be a value that is allowed in a multi-tenant SaaS environment

## Description
The compilation target of an application must be a value that is allowed in a multi-tenant SaaS environment.

[//]: # (IMPORTANT: END>DO_NOT_EDIT)

This rule validates that the manifest of your extension (app.json) specifies a compilation target that is allowed in a multi-tenant SaaS environment. For more information, see [JSON files](../devenv-json-files.md) and [Compilation Scope Overview](../devenv-compilation-scope-overview.md).

## How to fix this diagnostic?

You must set the value of `target` property in the manifest of your extension (app.json) to `Cloud`.

## Code example triggering the rule

The following manifest specifies `OnPrem` as compilation target and is then not allowed in a multi-tenant SaaS environment. 

```JSON
{
    "appId": "<some-guid>",
    "name": "MyApp",
    "publisher": "MyPublisher",
    "version": "1.0.0.0",
    "target": "OnPrem"
}
```

## Code example not triggering the rule

The following manifest specifies `Cloud` as compilation target and is allowed in a multi-tenant SaaS environment. 

```JSON
{
    "appId": "<some-guid>",
    "name": "MyApp",
    "publisher": "MyPublisher",
    "version": "1.0.0.0",
    "target": "Cloud"
}
```
