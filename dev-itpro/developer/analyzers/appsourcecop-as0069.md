# AppSourceCop Error AS0069
An enum field replacing an option field should have at least the same number of members.

## Description
An enum field replacing an option field should have at least the same number of values as the number of options members defined on the field in the previous version of the extension. Having fewer members might break the upgrade of existing installations and dependent extensions.
