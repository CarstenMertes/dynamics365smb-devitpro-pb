Fields must not change name

## Description
Fields must not change name; their names are case-sensitive. This might break the upgrade of existing installations and dependent extensions.

## Examples of non-valid name changes

### Example 1 - Rename field

Version 1.0 of the app:
```al
table 50 MyTable
{
    fields
    {
        field(1; Identifier; Integer) { }
    }
}
```

Version 2.0 of the app:
```al
table 50 MyTable
{
    fields
    {
        field(1; Id; Integer) { }
    }
}
```
The field `Identifier` was renamed to `Id`, this is not allowed and will trigger this rule.

### Example 2 - Change casing
Version 1.0 of the app:
```al
table 50 MyTable
{
    fields
    {
        field(1; Id; Integer) { }
    }
}
```

Version 2.0 of the app:
```al
table 50 MyTable
{
    fields
    {
        field(1; ID; Integer) { }
    }
}
```
The field `Id` had its casing changed to `ID`, this is not allowed and will trigger this rule.

### Example 3 - Rename currently obsolete field
Version 1.0 of the app:
```al
table 50 MyTable
{
    fields
    {
        field(10; "Cust. Rep."; Text[40])
        {
            ObsoleteState = Pending;
        }
    }
}
```

Version 2.0 of the app:

```al
table 50 MyTable
{
    fields
    {
        field(10; "Alt. Name"; Text[40])
        {
            ObsoleteState = Pending;
        }
    }
}
```

The field `Cust. Rep.` was renamed to `Alt. Name`. It is not allowed to change the name of a field if it is obsolete in both the previous and the new version, because the field is still part of the extension's API.

> [!NOTE]  
> This rule validates all fields independently of their Accessibility or ObsoleteState, because they are used when synchronizing the schema defined in the extension to the database.
