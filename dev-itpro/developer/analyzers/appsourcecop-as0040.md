# AppSourceCop Warning AS0040
Removing page properties that cause destructive changes is not allowed

## Description
Destructive page properties that have been published must not be removed.

[//]: # (IMPORTANT: END>DO_NOT_EDIT)

## Remarks

This error occurs when an attempt is made to remove page properties that have already been published and are considered destructive. Destructive changes can lead to data loss, corruption, or other issues that can break the upgrade process for existing installations and dependent extensions.

## How to fix this diagnostic?

To resolve this error, you need to avoid removing published page properties that are considered destructive. Here are the steps:

1. Locate the page property in your code that is being removed.
2. Restore the property to its original state.
