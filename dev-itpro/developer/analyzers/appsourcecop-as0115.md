# AppSourceCop Error AS0115
The obsolete state cannot change directly from 'No' to 'Removed'.

## Description
The obsolete state cannot change directly from 'No' to 'Removed'. This can break the upgrade of existing installations and dependent extensions. Instead, the obsolete state must be changed to 'Pending' in this version and changed to 'Removed' in a later version.
