# AppSourceCop Error AS0003
The previous version of the extension could not be found.

## Description
The previous version of the extension, used as a baseline for detecting breaking changes, could not be found in the package cache folder.

[//]: # (IMPORTANT: END>DO_NOT_EDIT)

## Remarks

This rule validates that the version of the extension specified as a baseline for detecting breaking changes can be found in the baseline package cache folder.

> [!NOTE]  
> The rule [AS0091](appsourcecop-as0091.md) verifies that the dependencies of the baseline can be found in the baseline package cache folder.

### Setting up AppSourceCop to detect breaking changes

In order to set up AppSourceCop to detect breaking changes, the version of the extension used as a baseline must be specified in the AppSourceCop.json file using the `version` property. The version specified is the exact version against which the breaking changes are validated. It is also possible to specify the `name` and the `publisher` of the extension in the AppSourceCop.json file. The `baselinePackageCachePath` allows you to specify the folder that will act as a cache for the baseline package and its dependencies for the AppSourceCop analyzer.

If the `baselinePackageCachePath` is not specified, the baseline and its dependencies are expected to be found in the dependency package cache path. The `al.packageCachePath` setting allows you to specify the path to a folder that will act as the cache for the symbol files used by your project. This is sufficient for most scenarios, but `baselinePackageCachePath` provides a higher accuracy as it ensures that the previous version of the extension will be loaded using the right version of its dependencies.

For example:
```json
{
    "name": "ExtensionName",
    "publisher": "ExtensionPublisher",
    "version": "1.1.0.0",
    "baselinePackageCachePath": "./.appSourceCopPackages"
}
```

> [!NOTE]  
> If you are using a workspace with multiple projects in Visual Studio Code, you must set the `baselinePackageCachePath` property in the AppSourceCop.json file.

## How to fix this diagnostic?

If you do not want to detect breaking changes in your extension, remove the property `version` in the AppSourceCop.json file.

If you want to detect breaking changes, verify that the version specified in the AppSourceCop.json file is correct and that the extension can be found in the baseline package cache.
