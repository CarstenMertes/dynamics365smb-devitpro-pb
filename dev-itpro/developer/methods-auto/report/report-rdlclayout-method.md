# Report.RdlcLayout(Integer, InStream) Method
> **Version**: _Available or changed with runtime version 1.0._

Gets the RDLC layout that is used on a report and returns it as a data stream.


## Syntax
```AL
[Ok := ]  Report.RdlcLayout(Number: Integer, InStream: InStream)
```
## Parameters
*Number*  
&emsp;Type: [Integer](../integer/integer-data-type.md)  
The ID of the report object for which you want to get the RDLC layout.  

*InStream*  
&emsp;Type: [InStream](../instream/instream-data-type.md)  
The variable in which to return the RDLC layout.  


## Return Value
*[Optional] Ok*  
&emsp;Type: [Boolean](../boolean/boolean-data-type.md)  
**true** if the operation was successful; otherwise **false**.   If you omit this optional return value and the operation does not execute successfully, a runtime error will occur.  


[//]: # (IMPORTANT: END>DO_NOT_EDIT)


## Remarks

Using the return value is optional. When you use the return value, if the RDLC layout can't be retrieved at runtime, then the system returns **false** and no error is recorded. When you omit the return value, if the RDLC layout can't be retrieved at runtime, then an error occurs, which states that the layout couldn't be retrieved. 

## Example

The `Report.RdlcLayout` method will throw a runtime error if the operation fails, either if no object exists with that object ID or if no RDL layout exists for that report. This code example shows how to write robust AL code to handle possible failures.

```AL
var
    layoutAsStream: InStream;
    result: Boolean;
begin
    result := Report.RDLCLayout(ObjectId, layoutAsStream);
    if result then begin
        // use the layout that now is available in the stream
    end
    else
        // handle that no object exists with that id or that no Excel layout exists for that report
    ;
end;
```
