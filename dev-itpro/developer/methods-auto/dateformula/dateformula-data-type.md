# DateFormula Data Type
> **Version**: _Available or changed with runtime version 1.0._

Represents a date formula that has the same capabilities as an ordinary input string for the CALCDATE Method (Date). The DateFormula data type is used to provide multilanguage capabilities to the CALCDATE Method (Date).

## Remarks

When a date calculation formula is stored in a DateFormula field, it is converted to a generic, non-language dependent format. When a date calculation formula is retrieved from a DateFormula field, it is converted to a valid date conversion string for the currently selected language.  

To assign a value to a DateFormula data type, whether it is a field or a variable, you must use the [Evaluate Method](../system/system-evaluate-method.md).  

The following table shows the syntax that is used to create the date formula.  

|Syntax|Description|  
|------------|---------------------------------------|  
|**30D**|30 days|  
|**2W**|2 weeks|  
|**CM+10D**|Current month plus 10 days|  
|**CM+1M**|Current month plus one month|  
|**CQ+1M+20D**|Current quarter plus one month plus 20 days|  
|**CW+1W**|Current week plus one week|  
|**D15**|On the 15th of each month|  

In [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], weeks begin on Monday and end on Sunday.  
 
## Example  

This example requires that you create a DateFormulaVariable variable that is a DateFormula data type.  

```al
if Format(DateFormulaVariable) = '' then  
  Evaluate(DateFormulaVariable, '<1W>');  
```  

You must use the [Format Method](../system/system-format-joker-integer-string-method.md) to make a comparison with a text string. If you do not use this method, then the `if` statement will fail because you cannot compare a DateFormula data type with a Text data type.
