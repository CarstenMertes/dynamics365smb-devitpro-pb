# TestPage.OpenView() Method
> **Version**: _Available or changed with runtime version 1.0._

Opens a test page in view mode.


## Syntax
```AL
 TestPage.OpenView()
```

## Parameters
*TestPage*  
&emsp;Type: [TestPage](testpage-data-type.md)  
An instance of the [TestPage](testpage-data-type.md) data type.  


[//]: # (IMPORTANT: END>DO_NOT_EDIT)

## Remarks  
 If *TestPage* is already open, then a run-time error occurs, and the outcome of the test method is FAILURE.  
  
 If the page to which *TestPage* refers is a card page, then the data that is loaded on the page is from the first row in the dataset.  
  
## Example  
 This example requires that you create a variable named CustTestPage with a Subtype of Customer List and that the codeunit in which you write the code is a test codeunit.  
  
```al
// Opens the Customer Card on the first Customer in the dataset.  
CustTestPage.OpenView;  
```
