# RecordRef.Number() Method
> **Version**: _Available or changed with runtime version 1.0._

Gets the table ID (number) of the table that contains the record that was referred to by the RecordRef.


## Syntax
```AL
No :=   RecordRef.Number()
```
> [!NOTE]
> This method can be invoked using property access syntax.

## Parameters
*RecordRef*  
&emsp;Type: [RecordRef](recordref-data-type.md)  
An instance of the [RecordRef](recordref-data-type.md) data type.  

## Return Value
*No*  
&emsp;Type: [Integer](../integer/integer-data-type.md)  
The table ID of the table that contains the record that was referred to by the RecordRef.

## Remarks  
 In versions of [!INCLUDE[d365fin_md](../../includes/d365fin_md.md)] earlier than [!INCLUDE[nav7long](../../includes/nav7long_md.md)], if a RecordRef referred to a temporary table, then the table number value of the RecordRef was the run-time generated sequence ID, which is from the base value of 2000100000. You could use the table number to determine whether a RecordRef referred to a temporary table. In [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long_md](../../includes/d365fin_long_md.md)], the table number value of a RecordRef always contains the ID of the originating physical table and not the run-time generated sequence ID. If you previously used the Number Method \(RecordRef\) to test for the sequence number and determine whether the RecordRef was temporary, then you must use the [IsTemporary Method \(RecordRef\)](recordref-istemporary-method.md) in [!INCLUDE[d365fin_md](../../includes/d365fin_md.md)] instead.  
  
## Example  
 The following example opens the Customer table \(18\) as a RecordRef object. The [Open Method \(RecordRef\)](recordref-open-method.md) accepts `Database::Customer` as an integer. The Number method retrieves the table number and displays the name and number of the table in a message box. 
  
```al
var
    MyRecordRef: RecordRef;
    varDatabaseName: Integer;
    varTableNumber: Integer;
    Text000: Label '%1 is table %2.'; 
begin   
    varDatabaseName := Database::Customer;  
    MyRecordRef.Open(varDatabaseName);  
    varTableNumber := MyRecordRef.Number;  
    Message(Text000, MyRecordRef.Caption, varTableNumber);  
end;
  
```
