# RecordRef.SetTable(Record, Boolean) Method
> **Version**: _Available or changed with runtime version 11.0._

Sets the table to which a Record variable refers as the same table as a RecordRef variable.


## Syntax
```AL
 RecordRef.SetTable(Rec: Record, ShareTable: Boolean)
```
## Parameters
*RecordRef*  
&emsp;Type: [RecordRef](recordref-data-type.md)  
An instance of the [RecordRef](recordref-data-type.md) data type.  

*Rec*  
&emsp;Type: [Record](../record/record-data-type.md)  
Specifies the Record that you want to refer to the table.  

*ShareTable*  
&emsp;Type: [Boolean](../boolean/boolean-data-type.md)  
Specifies whether the method copies filters, views, automatically calculated FlowFields, marks, fields, and keys of the record or creates a reference to a temporary record. If RecordRef and Record are both temporary and ShareTable is true, then the COPY method causes Record to reference the same table as RecordRef. If ShareTable is true, then both Record and RecordRef must be temporary; otherwise an error will occur. If you specify false, only filters, marks, and keys are copied.
