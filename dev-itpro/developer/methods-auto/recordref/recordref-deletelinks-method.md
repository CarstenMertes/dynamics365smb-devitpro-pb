## Example  
 The following example deletes all links from a customer record in the Customer table. The code starts by opening table 18 \(Customer\) as a RecordRef variable that is named CustomerRecref. The [Field Method \(RecordRef\)](recordref-field-method.md) creates a FieldRef variable that is named MyFieldRef for the first field in the table \(No.\). `MyFieldRef.Value` selects record 01121212 from the No. field. This record is initialized in the CustomerNum variable. The [Find Method \(RecordRef\)](recordref-find-method.md) searches for record 01121212. If the record is found, the DeleteLINKS method deletes all the links in the record. A message that states that the links are deleted is displayed in a message box. You can verify that the links are deleted in the **Links** FactBox on the Customer List or Customer Card pages. 
  
```al
var
    MyFieldRef: FieldRef;
    CustomerRecRef: RecordRef;
    CustomerNUm: Integer;
    Text000: Label 'The link with id %1 is deleted.;
    Text001: Label 'The customer cannot be found.';
begin     
    CustomerNum := '01121212';  
    CustomerRecref.Open(18);  
    MyFieldRef := CustomerRecref.Field(1);  
    MyFieldRef.Value := CustomerNum;  
    if CustomerRecref.Find('=') then begin  
      CustomerRecref.DeleteLinks;  
      Message(Text000, CustomerNum);  
    end else
      Message(Text001);  
end;
```
