## Parameters
*File*  
&emsp;Type: [File](file-data-type.md)

*[Optional] Mode*  
&emsp;Type: [Boolean](../boolean/boolean-data-type.md)

[//]: # (IMPORTANT: END>DO_NOT_EDIT)

## Remarks

This method should be used before File.Open is used to open the file. If you use this method on a file that is already open, then an error occurs.  
  
## Example  

The following example sets the TextMode to **true** when the file is open for writing. This means the file contents will be written to a text file that is named 'C:\\TestFolder\\TestFile.txt' by using ASCII characters. The [WriteMode Method \(File\)](../../methods-auto/file/file-writemode-method.md) and the [Open Method \(File\)](../../methods-auto/file/file-open-method.md) open the file for writing and the text ‘Hello World’ is written. The [Close Method \(File\)](../../methods-auto/file/file-close-method.md) closes the file after the file is written to. This example assumes that you have created a text file that is named C:\\TestFolder\\TestFile.txt.  
  
```al
var
    TestFile: File;
begin 
    TestFile.TextMode(True);  
    TestFile.WriteMode(True);  
    TestFile.Open('C:\TestFolder\TestFile.txt');  
    TestFile.Write('Hello World');  
    TestFile.Close;  
end;
```
