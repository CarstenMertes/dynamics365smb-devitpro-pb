# File.Exists(Text) Method
> **Version**: _Available or changed with runtime version 1.0._

Determines whether a file exists.

> [!NOTE]
> This method is supported only in Business Central on-premises.

## Syntax
```AL
[Ok := ]  File.Exists(Name: Text)
```
> [!NOTE]
> This method can be invoked without specifying the data type name.
## Parameters
*Name*  
&emsp;Type: [Text](../text/text-data-type.md)  
The name of the file that you want to check. This includes the path. When you enter the path, consider these shortcuts:
-   You can omit the drive designation if the file is located on the current drive.
-   You can omit the full path if the file is located in the current directory.
-   You can enter only the subdirectory name if the file is located in a subdirectory of the current directory.  


## Return Value
*[Optional] Ok*  
&emsp;Type: [Boolean](../boolean/boolean-data-type.md)  
**true** if the server instance has access to the file; otherwise **false**. If you omit this optional return value and the operation does not execute successfully, a runtime error will occur.

## Example

The following example uses the Exists method to determine whether the specified file exists. If the file exists, then the [WriteMode Method \(File\)](file-writemode-method.md) allows the file to be open for writing. The [Open Method \(File\)](file-open-method.md) opens the file, the [Write Method \(File\)](file-writemode-method.md) writes the text “Hello World” to the file, and then the [Close Method \(File\)](file-close-method.md) method closes the file. If the file does not exist, an error message is displayed. This example assumes that you have created the following file C:\\TestFolder\\TestFile2.txt.  

```al
 var
    TestFile: File;
    FileName: Text;
begin
    FileName := 'C:\TestFolder\TestFile2.txt';  
    if exists(FileName) then begin  
      TestFile.WriteMode(true);  
      TestFile.Open(FileName);  
      TestFile.Write('Hello World');  
      TestFile.Close;  
    end else  
        Message('%1 does not exist.', FileName);  
end;
```
