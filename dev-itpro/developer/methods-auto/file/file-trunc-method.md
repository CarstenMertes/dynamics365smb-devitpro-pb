## Remarks

Typically, you use this method together with [Seek Method \(File\)](../../methods-auto/file/file-seek-method.md). Use File.Seek to position the pointer in the file and then use File.Trunc to truncate the file at that point.  
  
## Example

The following example sets a pointer at position 20 in a file and truncates the file at the pointer position. The [WriteMode Method \(File\)](../../methods-auto/file/file-writemode-method.md) allows the file that is named C:\\TestFolder\\TestFile.txt to open in write mode. The Seek method sets a pointer at position 20 in the file and then the [Trunc Method \(File\)](../../methods-auto/file/file-trunc-method.md) truncates the contents at the pointer position. This example assumes that you have created a text file named C:\\TestFolder\\TestFile.txt. The file is then saved a truncated file. 
  
```al
 var
    TestFile: File;
begin
    TestFile.WriteMode(True);  
    TestFile.Open('C:\TestFolder\TestFile.txt');  
    TestFile.Seek(20);  
    TestFile.Trunc;  
end;
  
```
