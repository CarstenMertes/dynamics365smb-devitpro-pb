## Example

The following example uses the CreateOUTSTREAM method to export data from a table to an XML document. The code uses the [Create Method \(File\)](../../methods-auto/file/file-create-method.md) to create an XML file that is named CustXmlFile.xml in a folder that is named xmlData on drive C. The [CreateOUTSTREAM Method \(File\)](../../methods-auto/file/file-createoutstream-method.md) opens a data stream to output the data from the table to the XML file. The [Export Method \(XMLport\)](../../methods-auto/xmlport/xmlport-export-method.md) then exports the data and saves it at the specified location. The [Close Method \(File\)](../../methods-auto/file/file-close-method.md) closes the data stream. This example assumes that you have created a folder named xmlData on drive C. 

```al
 var
    CustXmlFile: File;
    XmlStream: OutStream;
begin
    CustXmlFile.Create('C:\XmlData\Customer.xml');  
    CustXmlFile.CreateOUTSTREAM(XmlStream);  
    XMLPORT.Export(50002, XmlStream);  
    CustXmlFile.Close;  
end;

```
