# KeyRef.FieldIndex(Integer) Method
> **Version**: _Available or changed with runtime version 1.0._

Gets the FieldRef of the field that has this index in the key referred to by the KeyRef variable. Returns an error if no key is selected.


## Syntax
```AL
Field :=   KeyRef.FieldIndex(Index: Integer)
```
## Parameters
*KeyRef*  
&emsp;Type: [KeyRef](keyref-data-type.md)  
An instance of the [KeyRef](keyref-data-type.md) data type.  

*Index*  
&emsp;Type: [Integer](../integer/integer-data-type.md)  
The input index.  


## Return Value
*Field*  
&emsp;Type: [FieldRef](../fieldref/fieldref-data-type.md)  
The FieldRef that refers to the field with this index in the key.


[//]: # (IMPORTANT: END>DO_NOT_EDIT)

## Remarks  
 The first field in the index must have index 1, the second index 2, and so on. The last field must have index = FieldCount. If the index is out of the range supplied or if no table is selected, the method returns an error.  
  
## Example  
 The following example displays the caption of a field in a record. The table with ID 18 \(the Customer table\) is open with a reference. The *Keyref* for the record is retrieved by using the [KeyIndex Method \(RecordRef\)](../library.md). The method retrieves the second key in the record and stores the value in the varKeyRef variable. The varKeyRef variable is then used to return the *FieldRef*. The varFieldRef variable is used to display the caption of the field. 
 
```al
var
    RecRef: RecordRef;
    varKeyRef: KeyRef;
    varFieldRef: FieldRef;
begin  
    RecRef.Open(18);  
    varKeyRef := RecRef.KeyIndex(2);  
    varFieldRef := varKeyRef.FieldIndex(1);  
    Message('The Field name is: %1' ,varFieldRef.Caption);  
end;
```
