Stores whole numbers with values that range from -2,147,483,647 to 2,147,483,647.

## Remarks  
 In addition to representing whole numbers in this range, you can use integers to represent Boolean values. For Boolean values, 1 represents **true** and 0 represents **false**.  
  
 If you assign -2,147,483,648 directly to an Integer variable, then you get an error when you try to compile the code. However, you can indirectly assign -2,147,483,648 to an Integer variable by using the following code.  
  
```al
IntegerVar := -2147483647;  
IntegerVar -= 1;  
```  
  
 If you try to indirectly assign a value that is smaller than -2,147,483,648 or larger than 2,147,483,647, then you get a run-time error.  


## Example 1

 The following are examples of integer values.  
  
```al
546  
-3425  
```  
  
## Example 2

 The following example is a decimal and not an integer.  
  
```al
342.45  
```
