## Example

The following example opens the Customer table as a RecordRef variable that is named CustomerRecref. The code loops through fields 1 to 5 and creates a FieldRef that is named MyFieldRef for each field that is selected. `MyFieldRef.Type` retrieves the data of each field and displays it in a message box. 
 
```al
var
    MyFieldRef: FieldRef;
    CustomerRecref: RecordRef;
    varType: Variant;
    Text000: Label 'Field %1 is a %2 data type.';
begin
    CustomerRecref.Open(Database::Customer);  
    for i := 1 to 5 do begin  
      MyFieldRef := CustomerRecref.Field(i);  
      Message(Text000, i, MyFieldRef.Type);  
    end;  
END;
```
