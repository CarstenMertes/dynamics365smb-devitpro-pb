# FieldRef.Record() Method
> **Version**: _Available or changed with runtime version 1.0._

Gets the RecordRef of the field that is currently selected. This method returns an error if no field is selected.


## Syntax
```AL
Record :=   FieldRef.Record()
```

## Parameters
*FieldRef*  
&emsp;Type: [FieldRef](fieldref-data-type.md)  
An instance of the [FieldRef](fieldref-data-type.md) data type.  

## Return Value
*Record*  
&emsp;Type: [RecordRef](../recordref/recordref-data-type.md)  



[//]: # (IMPORTANT: END>DO_NOT_EDIT)

## Example

The following example opens the Item table as a RecordRef variable that is named ItemRecref, creates a reference to field 1 \(No.\), and stores the value in the variable named MyFieldRef. The Record method uses the MyFieldRef variable to return the RecordRef of field 1 and stores the reference in a variable named MyRecRef. `MyRecRef.Number` returns the table that the selected field belongs to. 

```al
var
    MyFieldRef: FieldRef;
    ItemRecref: RecordRef;
    MyRecRef: RecordRef;
    Text000: Label 'The selected field is from table %1.';
begin
    ItemRecref.Open(Database::Item);  
    MyFieldRef := ItemRecref.Field(1);  
    MyRecRef := MyFieldRef.Record;  
    Message(Text000, MyRecRef.Number);  
end;
```
