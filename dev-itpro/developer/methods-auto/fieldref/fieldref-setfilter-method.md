# FieldRef.SetFilter(Text [, Any,...]) Method
> **Version**: _Available or changed with runtime version 1.0._

Assigns a filter to a field that you specify.


## Syntax
```AL
 FieldRef.SetFilter(String: Text [, Value: Any,...])
```
## Parameters
*FieldRef*  
&emsp;Type: [FieldRef](fieldref-data-type.md)  
An instance of the [FieldRef](fieldref-data-type.md) data type.  

*String*  
&emsp;Type: [Text](../text/text-data-type.md)  
The filter expression. A valid expression consists of alphanumeric characters and one or more of the following operators: \<, \<=, \>, \>=, \<\>, &, .., *, &#124; and @. You can use replacement fields (%1, %2, and so on) to insert values at runtime.  

*[Optional] Value*  
&emsp;Type: [Any](../any/any-data-type.md)  
Replacement values to insert in replacement fields in the filter expression. The data type of Value must match the type of FieldRef.  



[//]: # (IMPORTANT: END>DO_NOT_EDIT)

## Remarks

If the method is called with a field for which a filter already exists, the filter is removed before a new one is set. You can construct filters using the following operators.  
  
|Operator|Description|  
|--------------|-----------------|  
|..|Range|  
|&|And|  
|&#124;|Or|  
|\<|Less than|  
|\<=|Less than or equal to|  
|>|Greater than|  
|>=|Greater than or equal to|  
|\<>|Different from|  
|\*|Forms a part of value|  
|@|Case-insensitive|  
  
This method is like the [SetFilter Method \(Record\)](../record/record-setfilter-method.md) method.  
  
## Example

The following example opens the Customer table as a RecordRef variable that is named CustomerRecref. The [Field Method \(RecordRef\)](../recordref/recordref-field-method.md) creates a FieldRef for the first field \(No.\) and stores the reference in the MyFieldRef variable. The [GetFilter Method \(FieldRef\)](fieldref-getfilter-method.md) retrieves the filters that are set on the No. field and stores the value in the Filter1 variable. The value of any filter that is set is displayed in a message box. The SetFilter method sets a filter that selects records from 10000 to 40000 in the No. field. The [GetFilter Method \(FieldRef\)](fieldref-getfilter-method.md) retrieves and stores the new filter in the Filter2 variable and displays it in a message. The value in the Filter1 variable is blank because no filter is set. The value in Filter2 is 10000..40000 because of the filter that is set by the SetFilter method.
 
```al
var
    MyFieldRef: FieldRef;
    CustomerRecref: RecordRef;
    Filter1: Text;
    Filter3: Text;
    Text000: Label 'Filter before filters set: %1.';
    Text001: Label 'Filter after filters set: %1.';
begin
    CustomerRecref.Open(Database::Customer);  
    MyFieldRef := CustomerRecref.Field(1);  
    Filter1 := MyFieldRef.GetFilter;  
    Message(Text000, Filter1);  
    MyFieldRef.SetFilter('10000..40000');  
    Filter2 := MyFieldRef.GetFilter;  
    Message(Text001, Filter2);  
end;
```
