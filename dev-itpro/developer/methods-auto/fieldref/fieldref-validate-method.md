# FieldRef.Validate([Any]) Method
> **Version**: _Available or changed with runtime version 1.0._

Use this method to enter a new value into a field and have the new value validated by the properties and code that have been defined for that field.


## Syntax
```AL
 FieldRef.Validate([NewValue: Any])
```
## Parameters
*FieldRef*  
&emsp;Type: [FieldRef](fieldref-data-type.md)  
An instance of the [FieldRef](fieldref-data-type.md) data type.  

*[Optional] NewValue*  
&emsp;Type: [Any](../any/any-data-type.md)  
The value to insert in the field.  



[//]: # (IMPORTANT: END>DO_NOT_EDIT)

## Remarks

The Validate method first checks any [TableRelation Property](../../properties/devenv-tablerelation-property.md), and then executes the [OnValidate \(Fields\) Trigger](../../triggers-auto/field/devenv-onvalidate-field-trigger.md) of the field.  

If you omit *NewValue*, the method validates the current value.  

This method is like the [Validate Method \(Record\)](../../methods-auto/record/record-validate-method.md).  

## Example

The following example opens table 17 \(G/L Entry\) as a RecordRef that is named EntryRecref. The [FindFirst Method \(RecordRef\)](../../methods-auto/recordref/recordref-findfirst-method.md) searches for the first record in the table. The [Field Method \(RecordRef\)](../../methods-auto/recordref/recordref-field-method.md) sets the field to 3, which is the G/L Account No. field. The **VALIDATE** method validates and inserts the specified value \(1210\) into the field. The [Modify Method \(RecordRef\)](../../methods-auto/recordref/recordref-modify-method.md) modifies the table. A message that indicates the G/L Account No. field has changed is displayed. To show that the code in the **OnValidate** trigger is executed, design the **G/L Entry** table and add the following code to the **G/L Account No. â€“ OnValidate** trigger: `Message('The OnValidate trigger is called.');`  

```al
var
    MyFieldRef: FieldRef;
    EntryRecref: RecordRef;
    Text000: Label 'The G/L Account No. for record %1 is %2.';
    Text001: Label 'The G/L Account No. for record %1 has changed to %2.';
begin
    EntryRecref.Open(17);  
    if EntryRecref.FindFirst then begin  
      MyFieldRef := EntryRecref.Field(3);  
      Message(Text000, EntryRecref.RecordId, MyFieldRef.Value);  
      MyFieldRef.Validate('1210');  
      EntryRecref.Modify;  
      Message(Text001, EntryRecref.RecordId, MyFieldRef.Value);  
    end;  
end;
```
