|[AddFieldNo(Text, Integer [, Text])](filterpagebuilder-addfieldno-method.md)|Adds a table field to the filter control for a table on the filter page.|
|[AddRecord(Text, Record)](filterpagebuilder-addrecord-method.md)|Adds a filter control for a table to a filter page. The table is specified by a record data type variable that is passed to the method.|
|[AddRecordRef(Text, RecordRef)](filterpagebuilder-addrecordref-method.md)|Adds a filter control for a table to a filter page. The table is specified by a RecordRef variable that is passed to the method. This creates a filter control on the filter page, where users can set filter table data.|
