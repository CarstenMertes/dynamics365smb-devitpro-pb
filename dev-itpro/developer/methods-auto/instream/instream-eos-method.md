# InStream.EOS() Method
> **Version**: _Available or changed with runtime version 1.0._

Indicates whether an input stream has reached End of Stream (EOS).


## Syntax
```AL
IsEOS :=   InStream.EOS()
```
> [!NOTE]
> This method can be invoked using property access syntax.

## Parameters
*InStream*  
&emsp;Type: [InStream](instream-data-type.md)  
An instance of the [InStream](instream-data-type.md) data type.  

## Return Value
*IsEOS*  
&emsp;Type: [Boolean](../boolean/boolean-data-type.md)  
**true** if the stream has reached End of Stream; otherwise **false**.


[//]: # (IMPORTANT: END>DO_NOT_EDIT)

## Remarks

If you are reading data from an external component, EOS can return **false** even though no more data is available. This may occur if you have not called Read first.  
  
## Example

The following example opens the text file in a folder that is named MyFolder. The data in the text file is read into and input stream variable named StreamInTest. The [InStream.EOS Method](../library.md) is used to determine whether the input stream has reached the end. If the stream has not reached the end, the stream is read into a text buffer, which indicates that the stream has not reached the end until the stream reaches the end. You must also create the following file 'c:\\MyFolder\\MyText.txt'.  

```al
 var
    StreamInTest: InStream;
    FileTest: File;
    Buffer: Text;
begin
    FileTest.Open('c:\MyFolder\MyText.txt');  
    FileTest.CreateInStream(StreamInTest);  
    while not StreamInTest.EOS do begin 
      StreamInTest.ReadText(Buffer);  
      //Do some processing  
      Message('Stream is still processing')  
    end;  
    Message('End of Stream');  
end;
```
