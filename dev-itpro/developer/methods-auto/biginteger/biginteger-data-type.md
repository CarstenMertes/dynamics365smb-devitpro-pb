## Remarks  
 This data type is a 64-bit integer.  

 You must add an L to the constant definition to inform AL that the integer must be interpreted and treated as a BigInteger.  

 If you assign -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 directly to a BigInteger variable, then you get an error when you try to compile the code. However, you can indirectly assign -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to a BigInteger variable by using the following code.  

```AL  
BigIntegerVar := -9223372036854775807L;  
BigIntegerVar := BigIntegerVar - 1;  
```  

 If you try to indirectly assign a value that is smaller than -9,223,372,036,854,775,808, or larger than 9,223,372,036,854,775,807, then you get a run-time error.  

## Example  

```AL  
BI := 1L;  
BI := 455500000000L;  
```
