```
## Parameters
*HttpClient*  
&emsp;Type: [HttpClient](httpclient-data-type.md)  
An instance of the [HttpClient](httpclient-data-type.md) data type.  

*Path*  
&emsp;Type: [Text](../text/text-data-type.md)  
The path the request is sent to.  

*Response*  
&emsp;Type: [HttpResponseMessage](../httpresponsemessage/httpresponsemessage-data-type.md)  
The response received from the remote endpoint.  


## Return Value
*[Optional] Ok*  
&emsp;Type: [Boolean](../boolean/boolean-data-type.md)

## Ways that HttpClient.Delete calls can fail
The method HttpClient.Delete can fail and return false in the following ways:

## Example (HTTP DELETE)
A DELETE request deletes an existing resource. A DELETE request is idempotent but not safe, meaning multiple DELETE requests to the same resources yield the same result, but the request affects the state of the resource. To make an HTTP DELETE request, given an HttpClient and a URI, use the HttpClient.Delete method:

```AL
    local procedure DeleteRequest() ResponseText: Text
    var
        Client: HttpClient;
        IsSuccessful: Boolean;
        Response: HttpResponseMessage;
        ResponseText: Text;
    begin
        IsSuccessful := Client.Delete('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1', Response);

        if not IsSuccessful then begin
            // handle the error
        end;

        if not Response.IsSuccessStatusCode() then begin
            HttpStatusCode := response.HttpStatusCode();
            // handle the error (depending on the HTTP status code)
        end;

        Response.Content().ReadAs(ResponseText);

        // Expected output
        //   DELETE https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1 HTTP/1.1
        //   {}
    end;
```

The preceding code:
- Makes a DELETE request to "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1".
- Ensures that the response is successful.
- Reads the response body as a string.
