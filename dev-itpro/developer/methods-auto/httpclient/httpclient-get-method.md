## Return Value
*[Optional] Ok*  
&emsp;Type: [Boolean](../boolean/boolean-data-type.md)

## Ways that HttpClient.Get calls can fail
The method HttpClient.Get can fail and return false in the following ways:

## Example (HTTP GET)
A GET request shouldn't send a body and is used (as the method name indicates) to retrieve (or get) data from a resource. To make an HTTP GET request, given an HttpClient and a URI, use the HttpClient.Get method:

```AL
    local procedure GetRequest() ResponseText: Text
    var
        Client: HttpClient;
        IsSuccessful: Boolean;
        Response: HttpResponseMessage;
        ResponseText: Text;
    begin
        IsSuccessful := Client.Get('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/3', Response);

        if not IsSuccessful then begin
            // handle the error
        end;

        if not Response.IsSuccessStatusCode() then begin
            HttpStatusCode := response.HttpStatusCode();
            // handle the error (depending on the HTTP status code)
        end;

        Response.Content().ReadAs(ResponseText);

        // Expected output:
        //   GET https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/3 HTTP/1.1
        //   {
        //     "userId": 1,
        //     "id": 3,
        //     "title": "fugiat veniam minus",
        //     "completed": false
        //   }
    end;
```

The preceding code:
- Makes a GET request to "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/3".
- Ensures that the response is successful.
- Reads the response body as a string.
