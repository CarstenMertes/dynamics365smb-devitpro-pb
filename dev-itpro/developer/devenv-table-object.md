# Table Object

Tables are the core objects used to store data in [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long_md](includes/d365fin_long_md.md)]. No matter how data is registered in the product - from a web service to a finger swipe on the phone app, the results of that transaction will be recorded in a table. 

The structure of a table has four sections:

- The first block contains metadata for the overall table, such as the table type.
- The fields section describes the data elements that make up the table, such as their name and the type of data they can store.
- The keys section contains the definitions of the keys that the table needs to support.
- The final section details the triggers and code that can run on the table.

## Table extensibility limitations
> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Only tables with the [Extensible Property](properties/devenv-extensible-property.md) set to **true** can be extended.

> [!NOTE]  
> Extension objects can have a name with a maximum length of 30 characters.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> System and virtual tables can't be extended. System tables are created in the ID range of 2.000.000.000 and above. For more information about object ranges, see [Object Ranges](devenv-object-ranges.md).

## Table object limits 
The table object has limitations that are mostly dictated by SQL Server, such as the maximum record size, number of fields, and the number of keys.

For more information about current limitations on the table object, see [Object Specifications and Limitations](devenv-object-specifications-limitations.md)   

## Snippet support
Typing the shortcut `ttable` will create the basic layout for a table object when using the [!INCLUDE[d365al_ext_md](../includes/d365al_ext_md.md)] in Visual Studio Code.


[!INCLUDE[intelli_shortcut](includes/intelli_shortcut.md)]

## Table example

This table stores address information and it has four fields; `Address`, `Locality`, `Town/City`, and `County`.

```AL
table 50104 Address
{
    Caption = 'Sample table';
    DataPerCompany = true;

    fields
    {
        field(1; Address; Text[50])
        {
            Description = 'Address retrieved by Service';
        }
        field(2; Locality; Text[30])
        {
            Description = 'Locality retrieved by Service';
        }
        field(3; "Town/City"; Text[30])
        {
            Description = 'Town/City retrieved by Service';
        }
        field(4; County; Text[30])
        {
            Description = 'County retrieved by Service';

            trigger OnValidate();
            begin
                ValidateCounty(County);
            end;

        }
    }
    keys
    {
        key(PrimaryKey; Address)
        {
            Clustered = TRUE;
        }
    }

    var
        Msg: Label 'Hello from my method';

    trigger OnInsert();
    begin

    end;

    procedure MyMethod()
    begin
        Message(Msg);
    end;
}
```

## System fields

The [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long_md](includes/d365fin_long_md.md)] platform will automatically add several system fields to tables. For more information, see [System Fields](devenv-table-system-fields.md).
