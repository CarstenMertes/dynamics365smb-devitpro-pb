# Call external services with the HttpClient data type

You can integrate [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] apps/extensions with external systems by using the *HttpClient* data type in your AL code.

:::image type="content" source="media/httpclient.svg" alt-text="Shows how AL apps/extensions can call external web services from Business Central" lightbox="media/httpclient.svg":::

The [HttpClient data type](methods-auto/httpclient/httpclient-data-type.md) is simply a wrapper on the .NET class HttpClient.  

In this article, you learn how to make HTTP requests using the *HttpClient* data type and handle responses using the *HttpResponseMessage* data type.

## Set up an external call

The first thing you need to do is to define the HTTP request, that is, which URI to call, set request and content HTTP headers, and choose which HTTP method to use. You do this using the `HttpRequestMessage` data type.

The following example illustrates ways to prepare the request.

```AL
    local procedure SendRequest(HttpMethod: Text[6]) ResponseText: Text
    var
        Client: HttpClient;
        HttpRequestMessage: HttpRequestMessage;
        RequestHeaders: HttpHeaders;
        RequestURI: Text;
        Content: HttpContent;
        ContentHeaders: HttpHeaders;
    begin
        RequestURI := 'https://httpcats.com/418.json';

        // This shows how you can set or change HTTP content headers in your request
        Content.GetHeaders(ContentHeaders);
        if ContentHeaders.Contains('Content-Type') then ContentHeaders.Remove('Content-Type');
        ContentHeaders.Add('Content-Type', 'multipart/form-data;boundary=boundary');

        // This shows how you can set HTTP request headers in your request
        HttpRequestMessage.GetHeaders(RequestHeaders);
        RequestHeaders.Add('Accept', 'application/json');
        RequestHeaders.Add('Accept-Encoding', 'utf-8');
        RequestHeaders.Add('Connection', 'Keep-alive');

        HttpRequestMessage.SetRequestUri(RequestURI);
        HttpRequestMessage.Method(HttpMethod);

        // from here on, the method must deal with calling out to the external service. 
        // see example code snippets below
    end;
```

Learn more about content headers in [HttpContent data type](methods-auto/httpcontent/httpcontent-data-type.md).  

## Run the call

When you have set up the request, it's time to call out using a supported HTTP method. 

[!INCLUDE[httpCallErrors](../includes/include-http-call-errors-note.md)]

The following example shows how to call an external web service from AL. It also illustrates the error handling you need to setup for handling errors when sending the request.

```AL
    local procedure GetRequest() ResponseText: Text
    var
        Client: HttpClient;
        Response: HttpResponseMessage;
        IsSuccessful: Boolean;
        ServiceCallErr: Label 'Web service call failed.';
        ErrorInfoObject: ErrorInfo;
    begin
        // assume you have setup the request here

        IsSuccessful := Client.Get('https://httpcats.com/418.json', Response);

        if not IsSuccessful then begin
            ErrorInfoObject.DetailedMessage := 'Sorry, we could not retrieve the cat info right now.';
            ErrorInfoObject.Message := ServiceCallErr;
            Error(ErrorInfoObject);
        end;
    end;
```

### Server-side certificate validation

[!INCLUDE [2025rw1_and_later](includes/2025rw1_and_later.md)]

To enhance security of HTTP calls from AL, the AL runtime validates all server certificates used when calling a web service endpoint from the [HttpClient](methods-auto/httpclient/httpclient-data-type.md) datatype. Certificate validation is enabled by default. A server certificate is installed on the endpoint side, it's not the certificate you attach to a request in AL.

If an app or per-tenant extension needs to selectively disable certificate validation, you can use the [HttpClient.UseServerCertificateValidation(Boolean) method](methods-auto/httpclient/httpclient-useservercertificatevalidation-method.md), which allows the AL code to disable server certificate validation for the outgoing web service call.

If you need to debug failing HTTP calls due to server certificates that fail to be validated, telemetry is emitted if there are certificate validation failures. Learn more in [Analyzing server certificate validation errors with telemetry](../administration/telemetry-webservices-outgoing-certificate-validation-errors.md).

The ability to disable certificate validation is controlled by the [HttpServerCertificateValidation feature key](devenv-httpcertvalid-feature-key.md) to allow app and per-tenant extension publishers to modify their code. In version 27, certificate validation is enabled by default without the ability to switch it off.

### Supported HTTP methods

[!INCLUDE[SupportedHTTPmethods](../includes/include-http-methods.md)]

## Parsing the result

If the `HttpClient` call succeeds, you get a response back from the service you called. The response is saved in the data type `HttpResponseMessage`, where you can parse it to use the information in your app. The service call itself might not succeed, so make sure that you check the HTTP status code in your AL code.

The following example illustrates the error handling you need to set up for handling errors from the service that you called.

```AL
    local procedure GetRequest() ResponseText: Text
    var
        Client: HttpClient;
        IsSuccessful: Boolean;
        ServiceCallErr: Label 'Web service call failed.';
        ErrorInfoObject: ErrorInfo;
    begin
        IsSuccessful := Client.Get('https://httpcats.com/418.json', HttpResponseMessage);

        if not IsSuccessful then begin
            // handle the error
        end;

        if not HttpResponseMessage.IsSuccessStatusCode() then begin
            HttpStatusCode := HttpResponseMessage.HttpStatusCode();
            ErrorInfoObject.DetailedMessage := 'Sorry, we could not retrieve the cat info right now. ';
            ErrorInfoObject.Message := Format(ServiceStatusErr, HttpStatusCode, HttpResponseMessage.ReasonPhrase());
            Error(ErrorInfoObject);
        end;

        HttpResponseMessage.Content().ReadAs(ResponseText);
    end;
```

## Advanced scenarios

### Using cookies

Starting from 2024 release wave 1, you can use server-side cookies when calling an external service using `HttpClient`. This allows you to efficiently send and receive cookies in HTTP requests, unblocking scenarios where third-party endpoints require cookie customization.Â With the `Cookie` datatype and AL methods for handling cookies, you can automatically reuse response cookies, handle cookies manually, or a mix of both. 

### Using certificates

It's possible to include a certificate when calling an external service using `HttpClient`.

- [Supported cipher suites in HTTPS](devenv-supported-cipher-suites.md).

### Which IP addresses or ranges does my environment use?

When you exchange data through external services, you might have to safelist the IP addresses from where the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] service is running.

## Testing external calls

Testability of AL code that interacts with external web services is enhanced when the responses from these services can be simulated in AL, eliminating the need to configure actual endpoints. Mocking outbound web calls is useful when testing that your code is capable of handling a wide range of possible responses, and allowing you to track outbound traffic during the test executions.

To learn more, go to [Mock outbound HttpClient web service calls during testing](developer/devenv-httpclient-mock-outbound-calls.md).

## Monitor and troubleshoot

[!INCLUDE[httpclientTelemetry](../includes/telemetry-outgoing-http.md)]

### Application Insights

You can set up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to send telemetry traces to an Application Insights resource in Azure. Once set up, telemetry data is sent to the resource when web services are called using the HttpClient data type. Learn more in [Analyzing outgoing web service request telemetry](../administration/telemetry-webservices-outgoing-trace.md).
