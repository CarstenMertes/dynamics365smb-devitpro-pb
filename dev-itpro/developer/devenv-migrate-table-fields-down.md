# Moving Tables and Fields to Extensions Down the Dependency Graph

[!INCLUDE[2019_releasewave2_15.3_onprem](../includes/2019_releasewave2_15.3_onprem.md)]

This article explains how to move tables and fields from an extension to another extension that is down the dependency graph.

> [!TIP]
> For more information about the general concepts for moving tables and fields between extensions, see [Migrating Tables and Fields Between Extensions](devenv-migrate-table-fields.md). This article explains the the difference between moving up and down the dependency graph.

## Overview

The steps in this article are based on the example illustrated in the following figure. Although your scenario is different, the concept and process are much the same.

![Data migration.](media/data-migration-tables-fields.png "data migration") 

In the example, **TableB** and **Field C-2** are customizations. You'll keep these elements in the original extension, but create a new version without **TableA** and **TableC**. You'll move **TableA** and **TableC** down the dependency chain to a new, separate extension.

## Prerequisite

If you're moving [enum type](../developer/devenv-extensible-enums.md) fields, then your solution must be running on [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] 2020 release wave 1, version 16.5 or later. For more information, see [Known Issues](../upgrade/known-issues.md#enum).

## Create receiving extension (Ext Y)

The receiving extension will contain the table and fields that you want to move. In this example, these objects include **TableA** and **TableC**.

1. Create an AL project for the receiving extension.

2. Add a table object definition for **TableA**.

    The table definition (schema) must include the full schema of the releasing extension **Ext X**, with the same field definitions. You can add new fields.

3. Add a table object definition for **TableC**.

    The table definition (schema) must include the full schema of the releasing extension **Ext X**, with the same field definitions, except don't include field **C-2**. You can add new fields.

4. Make a note of the `ID` of the new extension. You'll use this ID in the next task.

    For purposes of the example, the ID is `11111111-aaaa-2222-bbbb-333333333333`.

5. Compile the extension package.

## Create new version of releasing extension (Ext X v2)

1. In the releasing extension AL project, add a migration.json file that points to the ID of the target extension.

    ```json
    { 
    "apprules": [ 
        { 
            "id": "11111111-aaaa-2222-bbbb-333333333333"
        } 
    ] 
    } 
    ```

    For more information, see [The Migration.json File](devenv-migration-json-file.md).

2. Modify the app.json file as follows:

    - Ensure that `"target": "OnPrem"`.
    - Increase the `"version"` value.
    - In the `"dependencies"` parameter, set up a dependency on the new receiving extension **Ext Y**.

    For more information, see [App.json file](devenv-json-files.md#appjson-file).
3. Complete the following steps for **TableC**.

    1. Add a table extension object **TableExtC**.
    2. In table extension object **TableExtC**, add a field definition for field **C-2** that matches its definition in the original **TableC** object.
    3. Delete the original **TableC** object.

4. Delete the entire table object for **TableA**.
5. Compile a new version of the extension package.

## Deploy extensions

1. Uninstall the old version of the releasing extension **Ext X**.

2. Publish the new receiving extension **Ext Y** and releasing extension version **Ext X v2**.

3. Synchronize the receiving extension **Ext Y**.

    This step creates empty database tables for **TableA** and **TableC** that are owned by the receiving extension **Ext Y**.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > The receiving extension must always be synchronized first.

4. Synchronize the new version of the releasing extension **Ext X v2**.

    This step first reads rules in the migration.json file of the extension, then does the following operations in the database:

    <!--
    - Migrates the data from the original tables **TableA** and **TableC** to the receiving extension tables.
    - Deletes the original tables  **TableA** and **TableC** owned by the releasing extension **Ext X**.
    - Deletes column **C-1** from the releasing table **Ext X**.
    -->
    
    - Creates a companion table for field **C-2** of the table extension object **TableExtC**.
    - Copies data from column **C-2** in the original **TableC** to new companion table **TableExtC**.
    - Temporarily renames the new empty tables **TableA** and **TableC** made by receiving extension **Ext Y**. 
    - Renames the original tables **TableA** and **TableC** that include the data. Instead of including the ID of the releasing extension **Ext X**, the names are changed to include the ID of the receiving extension **Ext Y**. This step essentially transfers ownership from **Ext X** to **Ext Y**.
    - Deletes the unused column for **C-2** in the original table **TableC**.
    - Deletes the empty, renamed tables of **Ext Y**.

5. Install the receiving extension **Ext Y**.
6. Run [Start-NAVAppDataUpgrade cmdlet](/powershell/module/microsoft.dynamics.nav.apps.management/start-navappdataupgrade) on the new releasing extension version **Ext X v2**.  

    This step basically installs the new extension version. You run a data upgrade because an earlier version has been installed and is still published.
