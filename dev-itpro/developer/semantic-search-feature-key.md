# Use semantic search to find pages and reports

[!INCLUDE [2025rw1_and_later](includes/2025rw1_and_later.md)]

This **Feature: Use semantic search to find pages and reports** feature key in feature management controls how chat with Copilot finds pages and reports based on search terms entered by users:

- When disabled, keyword-based search finds pages and reports by their matching metadata, like name and description. Users need to know the name of the page or report they're looking for.
- When enabled, semantic search finds pages and reports based on the meaning and context of the search terms, providing relevant results even if the exact words don't match. Users don't need to know the name of the page or report, only the context.
