# Use semantic search to find pages and reports

[!INCLUDE [2025rw1_and_later](includes/2025rw1_and_later.md)]

This feature key controls how chat with Copilot finds pages and reports based on search terms entered by users:

- When disabled, keyword-based search finds pages and reports by matching their metadata, like names and descriptions, to the search terms.
- When enabled, semantic search finds pages and reports based on the meaning and context of the search terms, providing relevant results even if the exact words don't match.

  Learn more about semantic search in [Semantic Search (SQL Server)](/sql/relational-databases/search/semantic-search-sql-server).
