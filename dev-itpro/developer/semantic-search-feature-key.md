# Use semantic similarity search feature key

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

[!INCLUDE [online_only](includes/online_only.md)]

The **Feature: Preview semantic similarity search on application metadata** key in **Feature Management** controls how the system finds pages and reports based on search terms entered by users:

- When disabled, Copilot uses keyword-based search to find objects by matching their metadata, like name and description. Users need to know the name object they're looking for.
- When enabled, Copilot uses semantic search to find objects based on the meaning and context of the search terms, providing relevant results even if the exact words don't match.

> [!NOTE]
> Semantic search is currently supported by chat and analysis assist (for related tables) with Copilot.
