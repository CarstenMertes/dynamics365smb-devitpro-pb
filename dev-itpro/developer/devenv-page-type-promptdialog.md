# The PromptDialog object

With [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] runtime 12.1, you can add a new page type `PromptDialog`, which allows you to integrate copilot capabilities into your custom scenarios. Use the `PromptDialog` to create generative AI experiences with the copilot look and feel, which includes signature visuals, and built-in safety controls for customers. The `PromptDialog` page has a specific page syntax, which includes new area and action controls, as described in the code sample in this article.

## Snippet support

Typing the shortcut `tpage` and then choose the **Page of type Prompt Dialog**, which creates the basic layout for a `PromptDialog` page object when using the [!INCLUDE[d365al_ext_md](../includes/d365al_ext_md.md)] in Visual Studio Code.

## Properties of the PromptDialog page type

The `PromptDialog` page type has some specific properties that characterize the dialog and must be set for this specific experience.

|Property|Description|
|--------|-----------|
|`PageType` | The `PageType` property must be set to `PromptDialog` for this specific page type.|
|`PromptMode` |The `PromptMode` property value is by default `Prompt`, which is the starting prompt mode. The `PromptMode` property can be changed at runtime. The other options are; <br> - `Generate`, which triggers generating the output of the copilot interaction, and <br>- `Content`, which shows the output of the copilot interaction.<br> You can programmatically set this property by setting the variable `CurrPage.PromptMode` before the page is opened.|
|`IsPreview` | The `IsPreview` property adds a specific note in the UI to indicate that the feature is in preview. It's by default set to `false`.|
|`Image`| To identify and ensure consistency in the UI for a generative AI experience, the `Image` property for the action invoking it, should be set to `Sparkle`. If there are multiple copilot options to choose from in the UI, the `Image` property can be set to `Image = SparkleFilled;` to make a specific action more prominent. To view a list of images, see [Available icons](https://aka.ms/bcicons). |

To find links to the properties related to the `PromptDialog` page type, see the [See also](devenv-page-type-promptdialog.md#see-also) section in this article.

## Areas of the PromptDialog page type

The `PromptDialog` page type has three areas, which are `Prompt`, `Content`, and `PromptOptions`. The `Prompt` area is the input to copilot, and accepts any control, except repeater controls. The `Content` area is the output of copilot, and accepts any control, except repeater controls. The `PromptOptions` area is the input options, and only accepts option fields.

## Example

The following example describes a page, which is a PromptDialog page, set with the `PromptDialog` option. The `Extensible = false;` is a mandatory setting, to ensure that the page isn't extended so that customers can trust the AI experience implemented.

Use the `IsPreview` property to indicate to your customers that you're using the feature in preview, and that the feature might change in the future as you gather feedback. The `IsPreview` property adds a specific note in the UI to indicate that the feature is in preview. It's by default set to `false`. 

The page calls the `RunGeneration` procedure, which *you must implement yourself*. This is where you call the copilot API, and get the results back. The `RunGeneration` method is called when the user clicks the **Generate** action. The **Generate** action is a system action that can be used on this page type and it's used to trigger the copilot interaction. The **Generate** action is also used to regenerate the suggestion, if the user wants to change the input to copilot.

For an example on how to implement the `RunGeneration` procedure, see [BCTech samples AzureOpenAI](https://github.com/microsoft/BCTech/blob/002affcf1520a710c270257d6547e25a9a223e85/samples/AzureOpenAI/Basic_ItemSubstitution/PromptDialog/ItemSubstAIProposal.Page.al#L111). 

For an example on building an AI capability, see [Build the copilot capability in AL](ai-build-capability-in-al.md).


```al
page 50100 MyCopilotPage
{
    Caption = 'Draft new job with Copilot';

    // Show the natural language user input as caption
    DataCaptionExpression = UserInput;

    PageType = PromptDialog; 
    PromptMode = Prompt; // Specify the starting prompt mode. Default value is Prompt.
    IsPreview = true;

    // You can have a source table for a PromptDialog page, as long as the source table is temporary. This is optional, though. 
    // The meaning of this source table is slightly different than for the other page types. In a PromptDialog page, the source table should represent an
    // instance of a copilot suggestion, that can include both the user inputs and the Copilot results. You should insert a new record each time the user
    // tries to regenerate a suggestion (before the page is closed and the suggestion saved). This way, the Business Central web client will show a new
    // history control, that allows the user to go back and forth between the different suggestions that Copilot provided, and choose the best one to save.
    
    SourceTable = TempInputData;
    SourceTableTemporary = true;
    
    Extensible = false; // Mandatory setting to ensure that the page isn't extended so that customers can trust the AI experience implemented.

    layout
    {
        // In PromptDialog pages, you can define a PromptOptions area. Here you can add different settings to tweak the output that Copilot will generate.
        // These settings must be defined as page fields, and must be of type Option or Enum. You cannot define groups in this area.

        // The Prompt area is where the user can provide input for your Copilot feature. The PromptOptions area should contain fields that have a limited set of options,
        // whereas the Prompt area can contain more structured and powerful controls, such as free text controls and subparts with grids.

        area(Prompt) 
        { 

            /* The input to copilot. Accepts any control, except repeater controls. */

            }
        }
    
        // The Content area is the output of the Copilot feature. This can contain fields or parts, so that you can have all the flexibility you need to
        // show the user the suggestion that your Copilot feature generated.

        area(Content)

            /* The output of copilot. Accepts any control, except repeater controls. */

            // the suggestion. When you develop a Copilot feature, remember: the user should always be in control (the user must confirm anything Copilot suggests 
            // before any change is saved).
            // This is also the reason why you can't have a physical SourceTable in a PromptDialog page (you either use a temporary table, or no table).
