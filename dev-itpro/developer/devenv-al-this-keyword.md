# Use the `this` keyword for codeunit self-reference

[!INCLUDE [2024-releasewave2](../includes/2024-releasewave2.md)]

The `this` keyword is known from many programming languages such as C#, JavaScript, and Python. The `this` keyword can be used in codeunits in AL as a self-reference, and it allows passing the current object as an argument to methods. Additionally, using the `this` keyword enhances readability in larger methods by clearly indicating whether a variable is in the global or local scope.

## Scenarios for using `this`

The main benefits of using the `this` keyword are:

- It allows codeunits to pass a reference to the current object (`this`) as an argument to another method.
- It improves readability by indicating that a referenced symbol is a member of the object itself.

The CodeCop rule [AA0248](analyzers/codecop-aa0248.md) is enabled by default with a severity level of `hidden`. Hidden means that it appears as three dots in the editor, but doesn't show up as a diagnostic in the **Problems** view in Visual Studio Code or in any pipelines. The CodeCop rule identifies where you can take advantage of using the `this` keyword. Additionally, a code action can help you update existing code to use the `this` keyword. Learn more in [AL code actions](devenv-code-actions.md).

> [!NOTE]  
> The newest version of the [System Application](/dynamics365/business-central/application/system-application/module/system-application) has been updated to use the `this` keyword for referencing methods and globals within the same object.
