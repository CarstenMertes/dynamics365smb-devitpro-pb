# User experience guidelines for errors

This article guides you on applying actionable errors to offer users recommended actions for more effective error resolution. It covers the key questions that error dialogs and validation errors should address, along with recommended voice guidelines for writing impactful error messages.

## Why should you deliver great error messages?

Improving error handling and error messages reduces friction for the users and highly impacts the user experience. Clear, informative error messages help users understand what went wrong and how to correct it, reducing frustration, and improving user satisfaction. 

For guidance on how to formulate good error messages, see [Error message best practices - what to say?](#error_message_best_practices) in the following section.

## Error messages with Fix-it actions – when to use them?

<br>Example of a validation error dialog with a Fix-it action:

For more information, see [Error messages with Fix-it actions](devenv-actionable-errors.md#fix-it-actions)

## Error messages with Show-it actions – when to use them?

<br>Example of a validation dialog with a Show-it action:

## <a name="error_message_best_practices"></a>Error message best practices - what to say?

Error messages are meant to unblock users. The primary purpose of the error dialog is to alert users to the fact that something has gone wrong and that they need to take action to continue. In the following, you find best practices for what to say in an error dialog versus in an in-line validation error situation.

### Error message best practices (Error dialogs)

Error dialogs should answer the following questions:

**Title:** [What went wrong]  
**Body content:** [Why, if relevant] + [How to fix it]  
**Button label:** [Clear action]  

### Error message best practices (Validation errors)
Validation errors should answer the following questions:

**Title (if needed):** [What went wrong]  
**Body content:** [How to fix it]  
**Button label:** [Clear action]  


## Error message voice guidelines – how to say it?

Use the following guidelines to remove friction for the users and positively affect the user experience, even when an error occurs. 

### <a name="error-message-titles"></a> Error message titles

The title of an error dialog is the first thing the user sees. Use the title to describe what’s wrong and enable the user to quickly scan the meaning.

- Be concise and describe the issue, not the action to take.
- Be brief. Just one sentence.
- Titles shouldn't end in punctuation.
- Not all validation errors need a title.  
- Keep in mind the relation between the title and the recommended actions. Actions should always respond to the title if there's one. 

### <a name="error-message-body"></a> Error message body content

In the body of the error dialog, use positive cases (telling what the user can do) where possible. Sometimes you need to tell what you can’t do, but for validation errors space is limited, so focus on the solution.

### Error message button labels (for Fix-it and Show-it actions)

When you need to use error dialogs, where possible use a Fix-it action or a Show-it action. To achieve consistency in the user experience of such error dialogs, consider following these guidelines for button labels.

For Fix-it actions, consider 
[!INCLUDE [fix-it-button-guidance](includes/include-fix-it-button-guidance.md)]

For Show-it actions, consider 
[!INCLUDE [show-it-button-guidance](includes/include-show-it-button-guidance.md)]

### Error message voice guidelines - do this

When writing error messages, consider using these overall rules of thumb:

- Use the word problem instead of error, issue, or technical problem. 
- Refer to the error message as a message and not an error or error message.  
- It’s OK to write "please" when asking the user to resolve a problem that isn’t their fault. 
- Only use "sorry" (and similar wording) in error messages that notify the customer about a serious problem or one that they might find frustrating. For example:
  - Data is lost. 
  - The user can't continue to use the device, service, or application. 
  - The user must get help from a support representative.  
  - A product or service fails. 


### Error messages voice guidelines - use contractions

To write error messages that are simple and feel human, consider using contractions:

- Use common contractions, such as it’s, you’re, that's, and don’t, to create a friendly, informal tone.
- Don't mix contractions and their spelled-out equivalents in UI text. For example, don’t use can’t and cannot in the same UI.
- Never form a contraction from a noun and a verb, such as Microsoft’s developing many new cloud services.
- Avoid ambiguous or awkward contractions, such as there’d, it’ll, and they’d.


### Error messages voice guidelines - avoid this

In error situations, it's crucial to show users we’re on their side. Utilize plain language and steer clear of the following words and phrases:

- “There was an error” or “An error has occurred” 
- “Error,” “Failed,” “Denied,” or “Invalid” 
- "Hmmm ..." or "Oops ..." or "Whoops" 
- Developer error codes like “WDGeneralNetworkError Error 500”. If you need to include a code, hide it under “details” 

Remember these rules of thumb:

- Don't overwhelm the user with technical terms
- Avoid robotic language and characters such as  `=`, `"`, and `()`
- Avoid long how-to or instructional guidance in errors. That content lives on docs.microsoft.com or in your documentation.
