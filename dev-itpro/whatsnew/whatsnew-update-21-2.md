## Good to know

**Use Service Support Administrator role to manage support requests on behalf of your customers**  
To better support this principle and align with the expectations of our customers, especially the Business Central customers working with other Dynamics 365 products, together with the Power Platform Admin Center team we introduce support for the [Service Support Administrator role](/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference#service-support-administrator) which gives access to manage support requests on the customer's behalf. If you need to log support tickets on behalf of your customers using Power Platform Admin Center, make sure you request this role in your GDAP relationship. 


**You can still watch the Business Central launch event recordings**  
We have 15+ What's New sessions and recorded Q&As available throughout January 2023. If you didn't watch them yet, you can still go to [aka.ms/BCLE](https://aka.ms/BCLE) to sign up. In November, two new sessions have been published for the following articles: [Embed Business Central in Teams tabs](https://app.hopin.com/events/business-central-launch-event/expo/815575) and [Access Business Central with your Microsoft 365 license](https://app.hopin.com/events/business-central-launch-event/expo/815576).

**AL-Go for GitHub version 2.2**  
Version 2.2 of AL-Go for GitHub has been released with improved multi-project support and a few fixes in the Pull Request workflow. See what has been added and changed in the v2.2 column in [aka.ms/AlGoRoadmap].


**Important: Take action before March 1 to retain your delegated admin access to your customers**  
Earlier this year, Microsoft Partner Center introduced Granular Delegated Administration Privileges (GDAP) as replacement for Delegated Administration Privileges (DAP) to enable partner-customer relationships that are time-bound and have more granular access rights. The timeline to migrate your existing DAP relationships to GDAP has been moved to March 1, 2023. If you don't take action by this date you'll lose access to your customers' Business Central environments. Refer to the Partner Center announcement [here](/partner-center/announcements/2022-october#17).

**Business Central Performance toolkit VSCode extension**  
The Performance Toolkit extension is built for Independent Solution Vendors (ISVs) and Value Added Resellers (VARs) who develop vertical solutions and customize Business Central for their customers. Because things change between released versions, it's important that ISVs and VARs can test the performance of their solutions to ensure that new versions don't introduce performance regressions when the volume of users grows. To help, the Performance Toolkit lets developers simulate workloads in realistic scenarios to compare performance between builds of their solutions. The Performance Toolkit extension helps answer questions such as, "Does my solution for Business Central support X number of users doing this, that, and the other thing at the same time?" Learn more [here](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-performance-toolkit).
