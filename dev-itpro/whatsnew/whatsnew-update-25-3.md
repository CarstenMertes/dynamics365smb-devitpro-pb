## Good to know

### Configuration packages for setup and evaluation data

We changed the way we prepare databases for new evaluation and production companies. Instead of using configuration packages to add demo and setup data, you now use the Contoso Coffee demo data app.

We shipped the Contoso Coffee demo data app in an earlier release to cover gaps in our demo and setup data, such as Manufacturing, Service, and Warehouse. Because the app is easy to use and now provides the comprehensive setup and demo data that was previously available in configuration packages, we're removing the configuration packages earlier available from the **Configuration Packages** page.

Starting with 25.3, when you launch the **Create New Company** assisted setup guide to initialize new companies with data, it checks whether Contoso Coffee demo data is installed and then displays a page that allows you to select specific demo and setup data.

#### For environment admins

In addition to making it easier to install rich demo data, this change also enables another improvement: flexible update policies for major and minor updates. Administrators now have extended update periods on environments. For major updates, there's a five-month period to test and prepare. For example, partners can spread out the workload of updating customer environments, and developers can verify app compatibility. Administrators can also opt out of minor updates during a grace period. Learn more at [Manage environment updates more flexibly](/dynamics365/release-plan/2024wave2/smb/dynamics365-business-central/manage-environment-updates-more-flexibly).

#### For developers

These changes might affect your extensions because we changed the logic of the **Create New Company** assist setup guide. Learn more in [Deprecated Features in the Base App: Configuration packages for setup and evaluation data](../upgrade/deprecated-features-w1.md#configuration-packages-for-setup-and-evaluation-data).

We continue to generate configuration packages for container and on-premises distribution media because some partners use them to run tests for their apps. This capability is a temporary solution to give partners time to switch to demo data generated by the Contoso Coffee Demo data app. It also allows partners to ensure that the tests are data agnostic and can generate needed data on the fly using available test libraries.

### New installation path started in 25.2

25.2 included internal database schema changes with the following consequences:

- New platform version 25.2 instead of 25.0.
- Different installation path than 25.0 and 25.1. Instead of using folder '250', components are installed in folder '252', for example: `C:\Program Files\Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central\252`.

Update 25.3 and future updates will also use platform number '25.2' and installation folder '252'.

### Business Central Launch Event videos on YouTube

This online event aimed to provide information about the new features and enhancements in the 2024 release wave 2 to resellers, partners, ISVs, and consultants.

### Features becoming mandatory soon

Prepare for features becoming mandatory soon. Learn more in [Optional features that are now mandatory](https://aka.ms/BCFeatureMgmt).

When the following features become mandatory, they might have potentially disruptive effects on extensions and apps you install in the future. These features are now optional to use and can be enabled in the **Feature Management** page in Business Central. Learn in more [Enabling Upcoming Features Ahead of Time](../administration/feature-management.md)).

- **Extending G/L Entry Aggregations When Posting Invoices**

   This feature is generally available with Update 23.1 and becoming mandatory in Update 26.0 (2025 release wave 1). The Invoice Posting interface replaces the use of the **Invoice Post. Buffer** table. The replacement helps resolve extensibility issues for the legacy Invoice Post. Buffer table. You can now use your own implementation of G/L invoice posting. As a developer, you can learn more about how to extend G/L entry aggregations when posting invoices [Extending G/L Entry Aggregations When Posting Invoices](../developer/devenv-invoice-posting-example.md).

- **New extensible exchange rate adjustment**

   This feature, including the posting review feature, is generally available with Update 23.0 and becoming mandatory in Update 26.0 (2025 release wave 1). New capability replaces the legacy Exchange Rates Adjustment Report. This new capability increases extensibility and makes it easier to comply with local and industry-specific requirements. It also gives you more control over exchange rate adjustments with a posting preview and how dimension values are post when you adjust exchange rate, and better reporting. As a developer, you can learn more about how to extend G/L entry aggregations when posting invoices in [Extending Currency Exchange Rate Adjustments](../developer/devenv-extend-exchange-rates.md).

Before the features become mandatory, work with your partner to update installed extensions and apps.
