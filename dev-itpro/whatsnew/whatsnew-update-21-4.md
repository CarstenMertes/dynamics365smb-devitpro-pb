## Localization updates

| Country| Feature  |Description|
|-------------|--------------|--------------|
| Mexico | [CDFI] New Electronic Document Status for cancelling a stamp from a Posted Sales Invoice | Electronic invoices in Mexico will have different statuses when they're being cancelled. When a business cancels the stamp on an invoice, Business Central shows an In Progress status until someone from SAT either approves or rejects the cancellation. The status that shows next depends on what’s done on the SAT side. If SAT approves the cancellation, the status of the electronic invoice becomes cancelled.|

## Good to know

**Important: Take action before March 1 to retain your delegated admin access to your customers**  
Earlier this year, Microsoft Partner Center introduced Granular Delegated Administration Privileges (GDAP) as replacement for Delegated Administration Privileges (DAP) to enable partner-customer relationships that are time-bound and have more granular access rights. The timeline to migrate your existing DAP relationships to GDAP has been moved to March 1, 2023. If you do not take action by this date you will lose access to your customers' Business Central environments. Please refer to the Partner Center announcement [here](/partner-center/announcements/2022-october#17).
