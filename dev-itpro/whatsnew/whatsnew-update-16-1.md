We have updated system requirements with the list of browsers supported by the Administration Center. When signing in from an unsupported browser that delivers a significantly degraded experience, administrators will immediately see a message that prevents them from continuing to the Administration Center. For example, it isn't possible to access the Business Central Administration Center from Internet Explorer.
