## Localization updates

| Country| Feature  |Description|
|-------------|--------------|--------------|
| France | New mandatory mentions on sales documents | New fields are required on the Sales Invoices in France following the decree of the French Tax Authorities: Client's SIREN number, the delivery address of the goods sold if it is different from the customer's address, information if the invoice includes goods, services, or both, and option to pay tax based on debits. |
| W1 | Added field Registration No. to Contacts | We already had added the Registration No. field to the customer and vendor cards, but this field has been added to the Contact card as well. |
| Norway | An electronic invoice in EHF 3.0 format validation improvement | Previously, an electronic invoice in EHF 3.0 format couldn't be validated successfully when the document contains a negative line for invoice rounding, and with this release it is improved. |
| Spain | Added field 'Closed' to the table 'No Taxable Entry' | Added the field 'Closed' to the table 'No Taxable Entry' to avoid pending amounts in VAT Declarations, so now users can filter 'No Taxable Entries' by Open or Closed status. |
| Italy | Intrastat | The Intrastat extension makes it easy to export the Intrastat report in the format that the Italian authorities require. |
| Italy | Service Declaration | The Service Declaration extension makes it easy to export the Service Declaration report in the format that the Italian authorities require. |

## Good to know

**Take action to retain delegated admin access to your customers’ Business Central environments**  
Last year Microsoft introduced [Granular Delegated Admin Privileges (GDAP)](/partner-center/gdap-introduction) to improve upon and replace Delegated Admin Privileges (DAP). GDAP addresses various security concerns by allowing customer administrators to provide partners a proper level of time-bound access to their tenants.

The Partner Center team has now [announced](/partner-center/announcements/2023-march#9) the timeline by which you need to migrate your customer relationships to GDAP. Please make sure to read this new Partner Center announcement for more details about milestone dates and the transition plan and about the tools Microsoft provides to facilitate this process.

To manage Dynamics 365 Business Central customers via GDAP we recommend requesting the Dynamics 365 Administrator role as the least-privileged role that grants access to Dynamics 365 Business Central environments. Read more about which other roles are supported for delegated administration of Business Central [here](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/delegated-admin).
