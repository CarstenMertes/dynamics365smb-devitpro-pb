## Good to know

**Available for all countries/regions: Schedule minor updates and receive email notifications**  
All customers can now receive up-front email notifications seven days in advance and schedule minor updates of Business Central within 21 days. We enabled this capability for US with 18.1, and are now enabling the same experience for all other countries/regions with 18.2. Learn more: https://aka.ms/BCUpdates.

**New ways of working with Business Central data in Power BI**  
In the upcoming June update to Power BI Desktop we have included a new connector for Business Central allowing you to get data faster from Business Central to Power BI. Note the update to Power BI Desktop is scheduled later in June and you will get it automatically if you have installed Power BI Desktop from Microsoft Store. Read more about the new capabilities [here](/dynamics365-release-plan/2021wave1/smb/dynamics365-business-central/enable-power-bi-connector-work-business-central-apis-instead-web-services-only). Please note that this change is for Business Central online only. 

**AboutTitle and AboutText properties**  
Weâ€™ve updated [AL reference docs](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/properties/devenv-abouttitle-property) with plenty of details, including the list of page combinations where the About properties have different or no effect. Update 18.2 fully reflects these behaviours.

**Business Central Office Hours Calls in June**  
Make sure to join the office hours calls around 'Working with Dimensions' on June 15 and 'DevOps for Per Tenant Extensions' on June 29. Register and stay tuned for the upcoming calls: https://aka.ms/BCOfficeHours. Also, notice that in the month of July, there will be no office hours calls. 

**Support for migrating data from earlier on-premises versions of Business Central to 2021 release wave 1 (v.18)**  
With the Business Central cloud migration tool, customers can migrate their data from earlier on-premises versions of the product to their online Business Central environment, running on the latest version. We've added support for customers who are running on Business Central on-premises version 14, 15, 16, or 17 to migrate their data to version 18 of Business Central online. We've implemented the necessary data upgrade logic in the cloud migration tool, so customers don't have to upgrade their older version themselves in order to migrate their data to the latest online release.
