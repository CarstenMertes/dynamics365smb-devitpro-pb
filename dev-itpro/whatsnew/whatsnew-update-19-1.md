Register and stay tuned for the upcoming calls: https://aka.ms/BCOfficeHours. Watch on-demand recordings: https://aka.ms/BCOfficeHoursRecordings. 

**Action needed: Client secret-based service to service authentication deprecation for Microsoft hosted tenants integrating to Dataverse**  
To ensure no disruptions in integration between Business Central and Dataverse you must upgrade your Business Central connection to Dataverse to certificate-based authentication. 
Although change will happen in March 2022, we strongly recommend you perform steps outlined in [Upgrade Connections from Business Central Online to Use Certificate-Based Authentication](/dynamics365/business-central/admin-how-to-set-up-a-dynamics-crm-connection#upgrade-connections-from-business-central-online-to-use-certificate-based-authentication) as soon as possible.

The sessions are within the following four areas: Administration and Development, Service and Platform, Better with Microsoft 365 and Modern Client.

**Find Records action in Power Automate Business Central connector**  
Coming to you in the coming weeks together with a cloud-based update of Business Central online connector for Power Automate is a new action allowing to find records based on a value (or any supported OData filter – more [here](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/webservices/use-filter-expressions-in-odata-uris)). This will allow you to create both instant or flows in Power Automate that get a value from the user or any system in a form of automation, then find data in Business Central and then process data in business Central. An example of such scenario was shown ad Directions EMEA 2021 in Milan in a form of chatbot hosted inside Microsoft Teams and built using Power Virtual Agents – that chatbot took an input from the user, found an item in Business Central and came back with inventory data.

**Customer References**  
We now have 100+ Business Central customer stories on the Microsoft Customer Stories site. These stories come in handy when prospects ask for reference stories, so remember to bookmark: [Microsoft Customer Stories Search](https://customers.microsoft.com/en-us/search?sq=%22Dynamics%20365%20Business%20Central%22&ff=&p=0&so=story_publish_date%20desc).

**AL Compiler Diagnostics**  
With the latest documentation refresh, the AL compiler diagnostics are published in preview. The AL diagnostics section lists all of the compiler errors, warnings, etc. that you can get when coding and compiling in AL. The topics are auto-generated and there is one topic per diagnostic rule, which allows for adding detailed help, hints, reference, and more. At this point, the topics contain only the error message, and adding more information is going to be a work in progress. To contribute with content, see instructions in [AL Diagnostics](../developer/diagnostics/diagnostics-overview.md).
