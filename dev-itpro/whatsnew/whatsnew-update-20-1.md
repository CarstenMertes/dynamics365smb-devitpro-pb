|-------------|--------------|--------------|
|Mexico | CFDI Payment version 2.0 | Payment receiving will be updated related with the version 2.0. New fields are included to identify whether the payments for the operations covered by the voucher are subject to tax. A new section is included with a summary of the total amounts of the payments made expressed in national currency, as well as the taxes that are transferred. |

| Denmark; W1 | Country code in the VAT Registration No. usage for Intrastat reporting | In Denmark companies need to use different VAT Registration No. models in Intrastat and Skat.dk (one with Country Code and another without it). To avoid issues for Stat.dk clients will use only value from VAT Registration No., but for intrastat clients will have additional configuration with the following options: VAT Reg. No., Country Code + VAT No., VAT No. without Country Code. This feature is available on W1. |
| France | Intrastat FR new requirements for DEB 2022 | For France, Intrastat management implies to separate the declaration data for the statistical reporting and for the fiscal reporting (recapitulative statement of VAT), once for obligation level 1 and once for obligation level 4. |
| Norway | Add support of the free text for each VAT return line | This is an improvement of the existing feature.

**Reminder: Avoid an unexpected data upgrade during cloud migration**  
When you run cloud migration from a previous version of Business Central, one of the process steps is to run the data upgrade logic to align the migrated data to the format of the current version. We strongly recommend that you perform this step one time after you have completed the migration of all your customer’s data to the online environment. If a planned Business Central major or minor update is applied to this environment, the update will automatically include the upgrade of the data that was migrated by the cloud migration. These planned updates also turn off cloud migration for the environment. To avoid this situation, and to allow you to complete the migration and data upgrade for your environment, we recommend that you postpone any scheduled major and minor updates for the target environment until you have completed cloud migration. You can postpone updates in the Business Central admin center. For more information, see [Managing Updates](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/tenant-admin-center-update-management).

**A new update to the Business Central mobile app for iOS and Android**  
There is a new update for the Business Central mobile app (version 3.7) for [iOS](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=734847) and [Android](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=734849) available in respective app stores. This app – as before – handles Business Central online and on-premises and the update is required for on-premises customers running Business Central 2022 release wave 1.

**The legacy Windows desktop app based on UWP technology only supports legacy on-premises Business Central**  
Just an update that the Business Central desktop legacy UWP app version 3.6.3101 has been released to the Microsoft Store - and marked as a mandatory update for Windows users.

- From now on users of Windows devices will only be able to use that legacy UWP app to connect to on-premises Business Central installations v19 or below. For v20 and later on-premises - see next point.  
- On-premises users of Business Central v20 or later will be able to use the PWA app installed from the browser directly (see [aka.ms/BCPWA](https://aka.ms/bcpwa) for more).
- All online Business Central users regardless of the version can use the new PWA app installed from the browser OR from the Microsoft store (again, see [aka.ms/BCPWA](https://aka.ms/bcpwa) for more).  

It is recommended to switch to the PWA technology as this is where customers can benefit fully from all web client features.
