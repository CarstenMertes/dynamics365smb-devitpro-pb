## Localization updates

| Country| Feature  |Description|
|-------------|--------------|--------------|
| Czech Republic| Copy Document action added to sales and purchase advice etters | The **Copy Document** action is now available on sales and purchase advance letters, allowing users to copy details from previously created documents, eliminating the need for manual re-entry each month. On the request page of the action, the only document types available to choose from are Sales or Purchase Advance Letters. |
| Norway | SAF-T 1.3 mapping update | Starting 01/01/2025, the new SAF-T form 1.30 is required but can be used immediately. It isn't fully backward compatible due to significant changes. The old form 1.20 remains valid for FY2024 and earlier. Users can now select the SAF-T version in the SAF-T Setup, which will generate different XML content based on the chosen version. |
| Spain | Adding new period type to the SII | In the new version, we've added a **Tax Period** option to the SII Setup, defaulting to **Monthly**. Companies required to submit the SII will have a **Monthly** tax period, while those voluntarily enrolled can choose **Quarterly**. Selecting **Quarterly** ensures the XML message reflects the correct value. |

### New installation path in 25.2

25.2 includes internal database schema changes with the following consequences:

- New platform version 25.2 instead of 25.0.
- Different installation path than 25.0 and 25.1. Instead of using folder '250', components are installed in folder '252', for example: `C:\Program Files\Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central\252`.

Future updates like 25.3 and 25.4 will also use platform number '25.2' and installation folder '252'.

### Business Central Launch Event videos on YouTube

### Features becoming mandatory soon

Prepare for features becoming mandatory soon. Learn more in [Optional features that are now mandatory](https://aka.ms/BCFeatureMgmt).

When the following features become mandatory, they might have potentially disruptive effects on extensions and apps you install in the future. These features are now optional to use and can be enabled in the **Feature Management** page in Business Central. Learn in more [Enabling Upcoming Features Ahead of Time](../administration/feature-management.md)).

- **Extending G/L Entry Aggregations When Posting Invoices**

   This feature is generally available with Update 23.1 and becoming mandatory in Update 26.0 (2025 release wave 1). The Invoice Posting interface replaces the use of the **Invoice Post. Buffer** table. The replacement helps resolve extensibility issues for the legacy Invoice Post. Buffer table. You can now use your own implementation of G/L invoice posting. As a developer, you can learn more about how to extend G/L entry aggregations when posting invoices [Extending G/L Entry Aggregations When Posting Invoices](../developer/devenv-invoice-posting-example.md).

- **New extensible exchange rate adjustment**

   This feature, including the posting review feature, is generally available with Update 23.0 and becoming mandatory in Update 26.0 (2025 release wave 1). New capability replaces the legacy Exchange Rates Adjustment Report. This new capability increases extensibility and makes it easier to comply with local and industry-specific requirements. It also gives you more control over exchange rate adjustments with a posting preview and how dimension values are post when you adjust exchange rate, and better reporting. As a developer, you can learn more about how to extend G/L entry aggregations when posting invoices in [Extending Currency Exchange Rate Adjustments](../developer/devenv-extend-exchange-rates.md).

Before the features become mandatory, work with your partner to update installed extensions and apps.
