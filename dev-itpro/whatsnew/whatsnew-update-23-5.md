## Good to know

### Access and administer environments as Dynamics 365 Business Central Administrator

Environments and the Admin Center can now be accessed and administered with the new Microsoft Entra role named Dynamics 365 Business Central Administrator. This role improves upon the roles currently supported in that it doesn't grant access to resources beyond Business Central, giving customers an option to grant internal and delegated administrators access to Business Central without giving access to other resources and services in the tenant.

There are no changes to the access granted to administrators with at least the Dynamics 365 Administrator role assigned. Delegated Helpdesk Administrators will soon lose access to the Admin Center; we recommend you replace any use of this role with the Dynamics 365 Business Central Administrator role. If you have accessed your customer environments using this role recently, you'll soon receive deprecation notifications sent to notification recipients set up in the Admin Center. Read more [here](/dynamics365/release-plan/2023wave2/smb/dynamics365-business-central/assign-more-granular-administration-rights).

### Shopify connector update  
With the previous minor update (23.4), we transitioned to the Shopify Admin API version 2023-10. Note that as of April 1, 2024, Business Central will no longer support the Shopify Admin API version 2023-04. To continue to use your integration, we recommend upgrading to Business Central version 23.4 or later before this date. You can see version of Shopify Admin API and the date until API is valid in the Shopify Shop Card page.

### Automatically update AppSource apps with minor updates  
You can now change the app update cadence for your environments to have AppSource apps update with every minor update. Read the [release plan](/dynamics365/release-plan/2023wave2/smb/dynamics365-business-central/planned-features) for more details.

### Features becoming mandatory soon
Prepare for features becoming mandatory soon on [aka.ms/BCFeatureMgmt](https://aka.ms/BCFeatureMgmt).
Following features may have potentially disruptive effect on extensions and apps you have installed in the future, when they become mandatory. These features are now optional to use and can be enabled in the [Feature Management](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/en-us/business-central/signin/?ru=https%3A%2F%2Fbusinesscentral.dynamics.com%2F%3Fpage%3D2610%26noSignUpCheck%3D1) page. 

**Extending G/L Entry Aggregations When Posting Invoices** feature is generally available with Update 23.1 and becoming mandatory in Update 26.0 (2025 Release Wave 1). The Invoice Post. Buffer table is replaced by the use of the Invoice Posting interface. The replacement helps resolve extensibility issues for the legacy Invoice Post. Buffer table. You can now use your own implementation of G/L invoice posting. If you're a developer and want to learn more about how to extend G/L entry aggregations when posting invoices, go to [Extending G/L Entry Aggregations When Posting Invoices](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-invoice-posting-example).

**New extensible exchange rate adjustment**, including posting review feature is generally available with Update 23.0 and becoming mandatory in Update 26.0 (2025 Release Wave 1) The legacy Exchange Rates Adjustment Report is being replaced by a new capability that increases extensibility and makes it easier to comply with local and industry-specific requirements. It also gives you more control over exchange rate adjustments with a posting preview and how dimension values are post when you adjust exchange rate, and better reporting. 
If you're a developer and want to learn more about how to extend G/L entry aggregations when posting invoices, go to [Extending Currency Exchange Rate Adjustments](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-extend-exchange-rates).
