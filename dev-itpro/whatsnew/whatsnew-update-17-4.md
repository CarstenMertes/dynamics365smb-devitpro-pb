OData V4 is the current recommended version of OData and current integrations needs to move to OData V4. To identify incoming OData V3 requests, enable and use the [Web Service Request telemetry](https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Flearn.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fdynamics365%2Fbusiness-central%2Fdev-itpro%2Fadministration%2Ftelemetry-webservices-trace&data=04%7C01%7Ca-emniel%40microsoft.com%7C7aa180a3769141bff89f08d8c6a2c84e%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C637477749732577916%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=1IbqoCHPSLXvT8%2FfRxJX252f5Bvtpn6bMZknet0wx2o%3D&reserved=0) that's available to partners.

**Basic Authentication**  
Basic Authentication (Web Service Access Key) removal for Business Central online has been postponed until [April 2022](../upgrade/deprecated-features-w1.md).
