## Good to know

### Schedule more tasks by using more users or Microsoft Entra Apps

With this release, we've completed the global rollout of all required changes to all regions of the Business Central service to support increased throughput for operations using scheduled tasks. In the past, the number of scheduled tasks our service could perform in parallel was limited to 3 per environment. This limitation was starting to become a bottleneck for larger customers and larger operational volumes, especially when using automation, running with many companies, or using traffic intensive web portals. We have optimized our service to provide additional scale for these workloads by allowing you to create more scheduled tasks per user (or Microsoft Entra App), rather than having a per-environment limit. To take advantage of this new capability, reconfigure your workloads and integrations to use more users and/or Microsoft Entra Apps, which will create scheduled tasks.

We are proceeding with applying similar changes for web service requests, so please look for further announcements in the next releases of Business Central.

### Features becoming mandatory soon

The following features may have potentially disruptive effect on extensions and apps you have installed in the future, when they become mandatory. These features are now optional to use and can be enabled in the [Feature Management](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/en-us/business-central/signin/?ru=https%3A%2F%2Fbusinesscentral.dynamics.com%2F%3Fpage%3D2610%26noSignUpCheck%3D1) page. 
- Extending G/L Entry Aggregations When Posting Invoices feature is generally available with Update 23.1 and becoming mandatory in Update 26.0 (2025 Release Wave 1). 
The Invoice Post. Buffer table is replaced by the use of the Invoice Posting interface. The replacement helps resolve extensibility issues for the legacy Invoice Post. Buffer table. You can now use your own implementation of G/L invoice posting. 
If you're a developer and want to learn more about how to extend G/L entry aggregations when posting invoices, go to [Extending G/L Entry Aggregations](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-invoice-posting-example) When Posting Invoices. 
- New extensible exchange rate adjustment, including posting review feature is generally available with Update 23.0 and becoming mandatory in Update 26.0 (2025 Release Wave 1) The legacy Exchange Rates Adjustment Report is being replaced by a new capability that increases extensibility and makes it easier to comply with local and industry-specific requirements. It also gives you more control over exchange rate adjustments with a posting preview and how dimension values are post when you adjust exchange rate, and better reporting. 

If you're a developer and want to learn more about how to extend G/L entry aggregations when posting invoices, go to [Extending Currency Exchange Rate Adjustments](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-extend-exchange-rates).
