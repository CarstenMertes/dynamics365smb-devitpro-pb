## Localization updates

| Country| Feature  |Description|
|-------------|--------------|--------------|
| France | Unique numbering for each Invoice in the General Journal | The numbering in the "EcritureNum" tag must increase over time and not contain any breaks. This transaction numbering must be unique for the whole file or specific to each journal code. Using numbers in the G/L Regusters provides unique numbering. However, if you post multiple invoices through one journal, all of the invoices will have one common number. But French regulation requires a unique number for each invoice.To fulfill this requirement, users now can run the report with an additional option, the Use Transaction No. |
| Denmark/W1 | Standard Audit File Export (SAF-T) | Users can export all mandatory required data according to the Standard Audit File for Tax (SAF-T) format in Denmark. SAF-T is an international standard for the electronic exchange of reliable accounting data from organizations to a national tax authority or external auditors. This feature uses Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) standard SAF-T as the standard file format for reporting and it can be used in all countries/regions if they are using OECD standard. |
| Denmark | Standard Chart of Account | The new Danish bookkeeping act requires the use of a standard chart of accounts. Because of this requirement, the Danish tax authority is providing a standard chart of accounts that can be used. Use the chart of accounts when you prepare annual accounts, and when you calculate regular tax and value-added tax (VAT) payments. You can use any chart of accounts that's included on the Chart of Accounts page. However, for required reporting, you must use the G/L Mapping page to map all general ledger (GL) accounts with the standard chart of accounts that's required by the law. |
| Denmark | Upload of CSV file with accounting data to RegnskabBasies | Integration of Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central with comma-separated values (CSV) file uploads is required by Danish bookkeeping act Regnskab Basis and marks a pivotal advancement in financial data management. This streamlined process enables your business to effortlessly import large datasets and helps enhance accuracy and efficiency. Now users can export all required data as a CSV file according to the Danish requirements for Regnskab Basis. |

## Good to know

### Important: Take action before October 31 2023 to retain your delegated admin access to your customers  
Last year Microsoft introduced [Granular Delegated Admin Privileges (GDAP)](/partner-center/gdap-introduction) to improve upon and replace Delegated Admin Privileges (DAP). GDAP addresses various security concerns by allowing customer administrators to provide partners a proper level of time-bound access to their tenants.

The Partner Center team has now [announced](/partner-center/announcements/2023-may#new-timelines-important-actions-to-secure-the-partner-ecosystem) the timeline by which you need to migrate your customer relationships to GDAP. Please make sure to read this new Partner Center announcement for more details about milestone dates and the transition plan and about the tools Microsoft provides to facilitate this process. 

To manage Dynamics 365 Business Central customers via GDAP we recommend requesting the Dynamics 365 Administrator role as the least-privileged role that grants access to Dynamics 365 Business Central environments. Read more about which other roles are supported for delegated administration of Business Central [here](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/delegated-admin).
