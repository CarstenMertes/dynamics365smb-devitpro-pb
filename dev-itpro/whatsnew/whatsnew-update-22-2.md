## Good to know

**Take action to retain delegated admin access to your customersâ€™ Business Central environments**  
Last year Microsoft introduced [Granular Delegated Admin Privileges (GDAP)](/partner-center/gdap-introduction) to improve upon and replace Delegated Admin Privileges (DAP). GDAP addresses various security concerns by allowing customer administrators to provide partners a proper level of time-bound access to their tenants.

The Partner Center team has now [announced](/partner-center/announcements/2023-may#new-timelines-important-actions-to-secure-the-partner-ecosystem) the timeline by which you need to migrate your customer relationships to GDAP. Please make sure to read this new Partner Center announcement for more details about milestone dates and the transition plan and about the tools Microsoft provides to facilitate this process. 

To manage Dynamics 365 Business Central customers via GDAP we recommend requesting the Dynamics 365 Administrator role as the least-privileged role that grants access to Dynamics 365 Business Central environments. Read more about which other roles are supported for delegated administration of Business Central [here](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/delegated-admin).
