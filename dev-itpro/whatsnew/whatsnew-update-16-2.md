## Good to know

**A change to the Web client header**  
The top-most header in the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] Web client and desktop app have been updated to align with other Microsoft 365 and Dynamics 365 apps. The most notable change is to the height of the header that has now been reduced to 48 pixels.

**Warning of performance impact when using configuration packages to import data**  
Configuration packages were designed to speed up the implementation of new companies. In case a customer wants to use Configuration Packages as a quick way to import data -sometimes big data- from other systems to Business Central, this small feature analyzes if the import will bring data to a new company or not and, depending of that and the size of the package, alerts the user that the performance of its tenant could be affected suggesting other ways to import or request partner help.
