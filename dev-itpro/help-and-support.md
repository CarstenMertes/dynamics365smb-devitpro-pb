This page outlines the resources available to you.  

## Product Help

The functionality in the default version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is described on the learn.microsoft.com site as described in the following table.  

> [!div class="mx-tdCol2BreakAll"]
> |Name  |Location  |Description|
> |---------|---------|---------|
> |Business functionality docs|[learn.microsoft.com/dynamics365/business-central](/dynamics365/business-central/) |Use this library to learn about business functionality. |
> |Development and administration docs|[learn.microsoft.com/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/](./index.md)|Use this content to learn how to extend, customize, and administrate [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].|

### AL developer documentation

In the [Development in AL](developer/devenv-dev-overview.md) section, you find descriptions of processes such as [compilation](developer/devenv-compilation-scope-overview.md) and [debugging](developer/devenv-debugging.md), and conceptual information about object types such as [tables](developer/devenv-tables-overview.md) and [events](developer/devenv-events-in-al.md).  

The reference documentation of the AL language publishes under the [AL Programming](developer/devenv-programming-in-al.md) umbrella. This content is partly generated automatically from code, but some of the reference content is maintained by hand. Use the following landing pages to quickly find the reference content that you need:

* Methods
  * [Data Types and Methods in AL](developer/methods-auto/library.md)
* Properties
  * [Properties Overview](developer/properties/devenv-properties.md)
* Triggers
  * [Triggers Overview](developer/triggers-auto/devenv-triggers.md)
* Objects
  * [Table object](developer/devenv-table-object.md)
  * [Table extension object](developer/devenv-table-ext-object.md)
  * [Page object](developer/devenv-page-object.md)
  * [Page extension object](developer/devenv-page-ext-object.md)
  * [Page customization object](developer/devenv-page-customization-object.md)
  * [Report object](developer/devenv-report-object.md)
  * [XMLport object](developer/devenv-xmlport-object.md)
  * [Query object](developer/devenv-query-object.md)
  * [Codeunit object](developer/devenv-codeunit-object.md)
  * [Profile object](developer/devenv-profile-object.md)
  * [Control add-in object](developer/devenv-control-addin-object.md)

### Product versions and Help versions

In general, the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](developer/includes/prod_short.md)] content on the learn.microsoft.com site reflects the latest version of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](developer/includes/prod_short.md)] online with limited support for earlier versions.  

If you support [!INCLUDE [prod_short](developer/includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, your solution might be one or two versions older than the latest version. This means that the content in the [business functionality documentation](/dynamics365/business-central/) might describe functionality that your users do not have access to. For a better experience, we recommend that you take a copy of our content at the time when that reflected the version that your on-premises solution is based on and deploy that to your own website.  

[!INCLUDE [ua-github-releases](includes/ua-github-releases.md)]

Learn more at the [On-premises deployments](deployment/configure-help.md#on-premises-deployments) section in the [Configure the Help Experience](deployment/configure-help.md) article.

### Customize and extend the user assistance

If you customize or extend [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you are expected to also customize the user assistance so that users will have access to content that can help them get started, get unblocked, and learn more. Learn more at [User assistance model](user-assistance.md) and [Configure the help experience](deployment/configure-help.md).  

### Dynamics 365 implementation guidance

Microsoft also provides content that can help you get started as a consultant, and you can find resources to help your implementation project. The [Dynamics 365 guidance hub](/dynamics365/guidance/) hosts non-product-specific implementation guidance, including [descriptions of business processes](/dynamics365/guidance/business-processes/overview). Learn more at [What is Dynamics 365 guidance?](/dynamics365/guidance/overview).  

## Support

As a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] reselling partner, you are an administrator of your customers' [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] tenants, and you are the first line of support. You can customize the support experience, and you have access to information that can help you troubleshoot any issues that your customers report.  

Learn more at [Technical Support](technical-support.md).  

## Training

You and your customers can find free eLearning content on the [Microsoft Learn landing page for Business Central](/learn/dynamics365/business-central?WT.mc_id=dyn365bc_landingpage-docs) with suggested collections for getting started, managing financials, and extending Business Central.  

The Learn site also includes role-specific learning paths for [developers](/learn/browse/?WT.mc_id=dyn365bc_landingpage-docs&expanded=dynamics-365&products=dynamics-business-central&resource_type=learning%20path&roles=developer), [administrators](/learn/browse/?WT.mc_id=dyn365bc_landingpage-docs&expanded=dynamics-365&products=dynamics-business-central&resource_type=learning%20path&roles=administrator), and [functional consultants](/learn/browse/?WT.mc_id=dyn365bc_landingpage-docs&expanded=dynamics-365&products=dynamics-business-central&resource_type=learning%20path&roles=functional-consultant).
