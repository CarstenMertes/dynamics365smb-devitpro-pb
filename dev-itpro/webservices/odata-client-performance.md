# OData/API client performance

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] supports OData web services (APIs and pages exposed as OData endpoints) to make it easier to integrate with external systems. As a developer, you need to think about performance of web services both seen from the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] server (the endpoint) and as seen from the consumer (the client). This article focuses on client performance.

## Using data access intent read-only

By specifying the HTTP header `Data-Access-Intent: ReadOnly` for GET requests, you can instruct Business Central to run requests against a replica of the database, which can lead to improved performance. To learn more, see [Specifying Data Access Intent for GET requests](../developer/devenv-connect-apps-tips.md#DataAccessIntent).

[!INCLUDE[database_access_intent_note](../includes/include-database-access-intent-note.md)]


## Using OData transaction `$batch`

Use OData transaction `$batch` requests where relevant. They can reduce the number of requests the client needs to do when errors occur. 

For more information, see [Using OData transactional $batch requests](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/webservices/use-odata-batch).

## Limiting the set (`$filter` or `$top`) if you're using an expensive `$expand` statement

Limit the result set using `$filter` or `$top` if you are using an expensive `$expand` statement. If you have moved calculated fields to a separate page, then it's good practice to limit the result set to get better performance.

## Specifying columns in the `$select` clause

Specify the columns you care about in the `$select` clause. By reducing the set of properties you reference in the `$select` clause, you can reduce the number of fields that have to be read from the database. This step in itself will improve the overall performance of the query.
 
> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] supports table extensions. If you omit the `$select` clause, your query will return all fields from the table, including fields from other extensions.

## Specifying columns in the `$select` expand option inside an `$expand` clause

Similarly to the `$select` clause guidelines, specify the properties in the `$select` expand option within the `$expand` clause. It is easy to forget, but if you omit it, your response will contain all the properties from the expanded object.

## Using a filter on `LastModifiedOn` when you query for historical data

When you query for historical data, the chances are that you're interested in the most recent period (for example, 30 days, 90 days). Because of how data audit fields are implemented in the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] database, there is a update of the data in the `LastModifiedOn` system field, which makes it perfect for history filters.

## Using `$top` query option to limit the number of records

Query option `$top` is only discouraged when used together with `$skip`. If you need only a subset of records (for example, if you just want to sample some data), it is fine to use `$top` query option. Additionally, if you need to rank records according to some criteria, you should always use `$top` in combination with `$orderby` to get stable result with top ranked records.

## Using server-driven paging

Paging ensures that the quantity of data that is returned by an OData URI doesn't overwhelm the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] server or client program that you use to capture data, while optimizing performance. 

For more information, see [Server-Driven Paging in OData Web Services](server-driven-paging-in-odata-web-services.md).

## Do not use `$top` and `$skip` query options to implement client-driven paging

With other REST APIs, you might have implemented client-driven paging with `$top` and `$skip` query options. Don't use them with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)]. There are several problems with this approach and performance is one of them. Instead, use server-driven paging.

## Timing an OData query

As with any performance recommendations, you should not blindly implement them. Instead, always capture a baseline and **measure** the effect of changes you make. All of the guidelines above were created based on the interactions with clients of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] who had specific requirements and challenges. These recommendations were considered general and potentially useful for anyone who designs similar queries. However, in rare cases, following the guidelines could have no effect or even a negative effect on the performance. You do need to measure the difference to notice it. 

There are many options to measure performance. The simplest one is to run two versions of the same query directly in the browser. Observe the time it takes in the developer tools. For example, you can use [Network panel](/microsoft-edge/devtools-guide/network#network-request-list) in [Microsoft Edge F12 Developer Tools](/microsoft-edge/devtools-guide)). Another option is to capture this information using [Fiddler Web Debugger Tool](/windows/win32/win7appqual/fiddler-web-debugger-tool). You can also use [Web Service Telemetry](../administration/telemetry-webservices-trace.md) to capture timings of OData calls. Note that only the endpoint and not the actual OData query is logged to telemetry.

Whatever your approach is, run both queries multiple times. For example, run the queries 30 times each to have a sufficiently large sample set. Then figure out the performance characteristics. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] uses a  multi-tenant architecture, so the duration of your queries might be affected by other operations that occur at the same time.
