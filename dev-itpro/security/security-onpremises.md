# Business Central (On-Premises) Security

This section helps you understand and improve the security of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] hosted on-premises. In the links below you'll find information, hardening guidance, and recommended best practices that address client, database, server, and network security.  

## Authentication

Before users can sign in to the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] application, they must be authenticated as a valid user in the system. Business Central supports several authentication methods. You configure the authentication method on the server tiers of Business Central.

For more information, see [Authentication and Credential Types](../administration/users-credential-types.md).

## Server security

[!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] handles communication between clients and databases, controlling authentication, event logging, scheduled tasks, reporting, and more. The following articles explain how to improve the security of [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] instances.

[Hardening [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] Server Security](enhancing-server-instance-security.md)  

[Locking Down Server Communication settings](security-lock-down-server-communication.md)  

<!-- [Using Multiple Business Central Servers for Stability](security-multiple-server-instances.md) available soon-->  

## Client security

The following articles explain how to improve the security of connections from the clients to [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)].  

[Configuring SSL to Secure the Client Connections](../deployment/configure-ssl-web-client-connection.md)

[Using Security Certificates with Business Central On-Premises](../deployment/implement-security-certificates-production-environment.md)

## Database security

The articles in this section explain how to improve database security in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)].

The following articles discuss configurations that you can perform on the Business Central server instance:

[Configuring the Database](../administration/configure-sql-server-authentication.md)

[Encrypt Traffic](enhancing-server-instance-security.md#data-encryption)

<!-- coming soon [Minimum database user privileges](security-minimum-database-user-privileges.md)  -->

The following are general articles about SQL Server security that can also help secure the database:
