# Security Tips for Business Users

This article describes how you can work with users and configure their devices to improve security.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Use this article together with industry standard security practices for securing users and their access to company data.

## Kiosks and shared devices

Customers using kiosks, where multiple users sign in to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] with their own identity from a single terminal, should apply additional security practices for an appropriate level of isolation between users:

- Before ending a session at the kiosk, business users should remember to sign out of Business Central, then close all browser windows. Closing the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] browser tab or closing the browser without signing out might not fully complete the signout process.
- Each user should use private or guest browsing modes so that any data cached by [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] is discarded when the browser is closed. Users should be made aware that private or guest browsing can degrade some [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] features and performance optimizations that are only available when the browser provides access to its storage mechanisms.
