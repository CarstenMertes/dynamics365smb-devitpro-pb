# Analyzing Error Message Quality Telemetry

**APPLIES TO:** [!INCLUDE[2022_releasewave1.md](../includes/2022_releasewave1.md)]

[!INCLUDE[azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id](~/../shared-content/shared/azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id.md)]

When a user gets an error message in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] while working in the application, the message includes a yes or no question as to whether the message was helpful, similar to the following illustration:

![Shows the error dialog and the voting actions, Yes and No, about the helpfulness of the message.](../developer/media/error-voting.png )

If a user selects either **Yes** or **No**, a signal is emitted and recorded in [!INCLUDE[azure-appinsights-name](../includes/azure-appinsights-name.md)]. This information can help partners and developers get insight into error messages that users find hard to understand. They can then follow up with the customer to help out.

This voting feature appears on all error messages that are thrown by calls to the [Error(String)](../developer/methods-auto/dialog/dialog-error-string-joker-method.md) and [Error(ErrorInfo)](../developer/methods-auto/dialog/dialog-error-errorinfo-method.md) methods.

## <a name="succeeded"></a>User gave feedback on error message

Occurs when a use selects either **Yes** or **No** to the question on the error dialog as to whether the message was helpful.
