# Analyzing Performance Toolkit Telemetry

[!INCLUDE[2022_releasewave1](../includes/2022_releasewave1.md)]

[!INCLUDE[azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id](~/../shared-content/shared/azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id.md)]

The Performance Toolkit (BCPT) extension is built for Independent Solution Vendors (ISVs) and Value Added Resellers (VARs) who develop vertical solutions and customize Business Central for their customers. Because things change between released versions, it's important that ISVs and VARs can test the performance of their solutions to ensure that new versions don't introduce performance regressions when the volume of users grows. To help, the Performance Toolkit lets developers simulate workloads in realistic scenarios to compare performance between builds of their solutions.

The Performance Toolkit extension helps answer questions such as, "Does my solution for Business Central support X number of users doing this, that, and the other thing at the same time?"

The extension doesn't answer questions such as, "How many orders can Business Central process per hour?"

To gather this data, you'll have to install and implement the Performance Toolkit extension.  For more information, see [The Performance Toolkit Extension](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-performance-toolkit) in the Development help.

Telemetry is then logged for the following operations:

- When the BCPT header has the status Started
- When the BCPT header has the status Completed
- When the BCPT header has the status Cancelled
- When a BCPT scenario is finished

## <a name="started"></a>When the BCPT header has the status started

Occurs when the BCPT header gets the status running.
