# Mount or Dismount a Tenant on a Business Central Server Instance

If a [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] instance is configured for multitenancy, then you can mount and dismount tenant databases by using the [!INCLUDE[admintool](../developer/includes/admintool.md)] or **Mount-NAVTenant** or **Dismount-NAVTenant** cmdlets in [!INCLUDE[adminshell](../developer/includes/adminshell.md)].  

Mounting a tenant by using the [!INCLUDE[admintool](../developer/includes/admintool.md)] requires that you have a running [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] instance. This isn't required when you use the [!INCLUDE[adminshell](../developer/includes/adminshell.md)]. With the **Mount-NAVTenant**, you can mount a tenant by either specifying the [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] instance, if it's running, or the application database.  

This article describes how to use the [!INCLUDE[admintool](../developer/includes/admintool.md)] to mount or dismount a tenant. For more information about how to use the [!INCLUDE[adminshell](../developer/includes/adminshell.md)], see [Mount-NAVTenant](/powershell/module/microsoft.dynamics.nav.management/mount-navtenant) and [Dismount-NAVTenant](/powershell/module/microsoft.dynamics.nav.management/dismount-navtenant).

## To mount or dismount a tenant

1. Open the [!INCLUDE[admintool](../developer/includes/admintool.md)].  

2. Verify that the [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] instance that you want to mount the tenant on is running, and if not, then start it:  

    1. In the left pane of [!INCLUDE[admintool](../developer/includes/admintool.md)], choose a [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] computer. Unless you're administering a remote computer, the choice is **[!INCLUDE[prod_long](../developer/includes/prod_long.md)] \(local\)**.  

    2. In the center pane, if the **Status** of the [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] instance is **Stopped**, then right-click it, and then choose **Start**.  

3. In the left pane, expand item for the [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] instance on which you want to mount the tenant, and then choose the **Tenants** item.  

4. To mount a tenant, in the **Actions** pane, choose **Mount Tenant**, fill in the parameters on the **Mount Tenant** dialog box, and then choose the **OK** button.  

     To get help on a setting, place your point on caption to display a tooltip.  

5. To save the changes, choose the **OK** button.  

     If you specified the **DatabaseUserName** and **ProtectedDatabasePassword** settings for SQL Server authentication, on the **Enable Encryption on SQL Server Connections** dialog box, choose the **OK** button.  

     Encryption keys are to secure the login credentials over the connection between the [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] instance and the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] database in SQL Server.  

6. Choose the **OK** button to save the changes.  

## Dismount a tenant  

- In the center pane, right-click the tenant, and then choose **Dismount Tenant**.
