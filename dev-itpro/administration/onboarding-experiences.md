# Onboarding experiences in Business Central

Setting up [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] for a customer usually involves manual setup from the partners' side. Often this setup time is spent on basic settings that don't provide extra value to the specific customer but are more generic and address the customer's industry or type of business. This is costly for the customer and can be a bottleneck for you as a partner.  

Microsoft provides tools you can use to help speed up this process and enable the customer to more easily learn how to use the product and get to productive usage faster. This saves costs on the customer side and free up your consultants' time.  

The onboarding framework in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] presents all users with a consistent onboarding experience when it comes to an introduction to the product itself. Partners can still use any other methodology that they prefer, but the tools in the onboarding framework provide a native experience.
