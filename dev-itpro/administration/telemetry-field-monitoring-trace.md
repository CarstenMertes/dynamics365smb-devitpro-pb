# Analyzing Field Monitoring Telemetry

[!INCLUDE[2020_releasewave2-17-1-later](../includes/2020_releasewave2-17-1-later.md)]

Keeping sensitive data secure and private is a core concern for most businesses. To add a layer of security, you can monitor important fields when someone changes a value. For example, you might want to know if someone changes your company's IBAN number.

To gather this data, you'll have to start field monitoring and specify the fields that you want to monitor.  For more information, see [Auditing Changes in Business Central - Monitoring Sensitive Fields](/dynamics365/business-central/across-log-changes#monitoring-sensitive-fields) in the Application help.

Telemetry is then logged for the following operations:

- When field monitoring is stopped or started
- When a field is added or removed for monitoring (only in version 18.0 and later)
- When a field value is changed  

## <a name="status"></a>Sensitive field monitor status changed

Occurs when the field monitor feature is started or stopped in the company.

|alMonitorStatus|**Yes** - the field monitor feature was started.<br /><br /> **No** the field monitor feature was stopped. This dimension is called "almonitorStatus" before version 18.0.|

<a name="other"></a>**Common custom dimensions**

The following table explains other custom dimensions that are common to all field monitoring traces. 

|Dimension|Description or value|

|environmentName| [!INCLUDE[environmentName](../includes/include-telemetry-dimension-environment-name.md)] |
|environmentType| [!INCLUDE[environmentType](../includes/include-telemetry-dimension-environment-type.md)] |


## <a name="changed"></a>Sensitive field value has changed

Occurs the value of a monitored field has changed in the company.
