# Analyzing Task Scheduler Telemetry

[!INCLUDE[2021_releasewave2.md](../includes/2021_releasewave2.md)]

[!INCLUDE[azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id](~/../shared-content/shared/azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id.md)]

[!INCLUDE[task_scheduler_telemetry](../includes/include-telemetry-task-scheduler.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> In this article, *main codeunit* refers to the codeunit that's run by the TaskScheduler.CreateTask method.

Each scheduled task is assigned a unique identifier (ID), which is included in each trace related to the task. Using the ID makes it easy to query the flow of a task.

## Task created

Occurs when a task was created by a `TaskScheduler.CreateTask` method call in AL code.

### General dimensions

The following table explains the general dimensions of this trace.

|Dimension|Description or value|
|---------|-----|

## Task canceled

Occurs when the execution of a task's main or failure codeunit is canceled by the service or by a user.

For example, the service cancels a task when:

- It takes longer to complete than the specified timeout. The timeout is specified on the task when it's created. Or if no timeout is specified, then the default timeout of the service is used. For online, the default task timeout is 12 hours. For on-premises, the default timeout is specified by the **Default Task Scheduler Session Timeout** setting on the Business Central Server instance.
- The Session.StopSession method was called from AL code.

Users can cancel a task a couple ways. For example, with Business Central online, they can use the Business Central admin center. With on-premises, they can run the [Remove-NAVSession cmdlet](/powershell/module/microsoft.dynamics.nav.management/remove-navserversession).

### Analyzing report generation failures

When a task fails, the `failureReason` column in the CustomDimensions will include the name of the exception that was thrown by the AL runtime.  

### Sample KQL code (failed tasks)

This KQL code can help you get started analyzing task failures:

```kql
// Task failed
traces
| where timestamp > ago(60d) // adjust as needed
| where customDimensions has 'LC0045' // for performance 
| where customDimensions.eventId == 'LC0045'
| project timestamp
// in which environment/company did it happen
, aadTenantId = customDimensions.aadTenantId
, environmentName = customDimensions.environmentName
, environmentType = customDimensions.environmentType
, companyName = customDimensions.companyName
// what codeunit to run
, codeunitObjectId = customDimensions.codeunitObjectId
, failureCodeunitObjectId = customDimensions.failureCodeunitObjectId
// task info
, formatId = customDimensions.formatId
, isReady = customDimensions.isReady
, languageId = customDimensions.languageId
, notBefore = customDimensions.notBefore
, taskId = customDimensions.taskId
, timeout = customDimensions.timeout
// execution info
, failureReason = customDimensions.failureReason // this contains the name of the exception thrown by the AL runtime
```

## Task completed

Occurs when the execution of a task's main codeunit or failure codeunit succeeds with no errors.

There's no event emitted for task started. You can infer the task-start time by subtracting the totalTime from the task completed timestamp.

### General dimensions

The following table explains the general dimensions of this trace.

|Dimension|Description or value|
|---------|-----|
|message|**Task {taskId} main codeunit {codeunitObjectId} completed.** - This message indicates that the task was fully executed successfully.<br><br>**Task {taskId} failure codeunit {failureCodeunitObjectId} completed.** - This message indicates that an error occurred in the task, but it was successfully handled by the failure codeunit.|

## Task timeout changed because it was exceeding the max timeout value

**INTRODUCED IN:** Version 22.0 

Occurs if the timeout defined on a task exceeds that maximum timeout allowed by the server. The task is then assigned the timeout that's equal to the maximum timeout allowed by the server.

> [!NOTE]
> For Business Central online, the maximum timeout allowed is 23:59:59. For Business Central on-premises, the maximum timeout allowed is determined by the `MaxTaskSchedulerSessionTimeout` setting on the Business Central server instance (for more information, see [Configure Business Central Server](configure-server-instance.md#Task).
