# Analyzing Extension Upload Validation Telemetry 

[!INCLUDE[component](../developer/includes/online_only.md)]

[!INCLUDE[azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id](~/../shared-content/shared/azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id.md)]

In the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] service, when a user/administrator uploads a per-tenant extension to an environment from the Extension Management page, we proactively validate it against the environment.

With this telemetry, partners can monitor these attempts for customers and setup alerts on failures so that they know up-front which customers will need help.

Failed operations result in a trace log entry that includes a reason for the failure.

The validation flow is as follows:

```text
The PTE submission validation flow is as follows:

PTE submission validation request started (LC0200). This includes the main extension to be validated and a list of extensions it depends on.
For each extension (main + dependent extensions)
        Extension validation started (LC0204)

        Either 
                Extension validation completed successfully (LC0205)
        or
                Validation diagnostic reported (LC0210)
                Extension validation completed with failures (LC0206)

Then either 
        PTE submission validation request completed successfully (LC0202)
or
        PTE submission validation request completed with failures (LC0203)
```

### Sample KQL code (Per-tenant extension (PTE) validation completed with failures)

This KQL code can help you get started analyzing validation failures for uploading an extension to the environment:

```kql
// PTE submission validation request completed with failures: request <submission id>	
traces 
| where customDimensions has "LC0203"
| where customDimensions.eventId == "LC0203"
| where timestamp > ago(30d) // adjust as needed
| extend mainExtension = parse_json(tostring( customDimensions.mainExtension ))
| project timestamp
// in which environment is the extension being validated
, aadTenantId = case(
  isnotempty(customDimensions.aadTenantId), customDimensions.aadTenantId  
, isnotempty(customDimensions.environmentId), customDimensions.environmentId
, 'Unknown'
)
, environmentName = customDimensions.environmentName
// which extension/app is being validated
, mainExtensionId = mainExtension.Id
, mainExtensionPublisher = mainExtension.Publisher
, mainExtensionVersion = mainExtension.Version 
, mainExtensionName = mainExtension.Name 
, dependentExtensions = customDimensions.dependentExtensions
// validation info
, submissionOperationId = customDimensions.submissionOperationId  
, failureReason = customDimensions.failureReason
```
