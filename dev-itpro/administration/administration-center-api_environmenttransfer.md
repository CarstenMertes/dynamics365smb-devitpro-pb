# Transfer environments

Environments can be transferred between Microsoft Entra tenants by internal administrators, for example when multiple Microsoft Entra tenants are consolidated, when a business is acquired by or merging with another business, or when a partner prepares a demo environment in their tenant that needs to be transferred to the customer tenant for the customer to evaluate.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> All environment transfer operations must be executed by internal administrators; it is not possible to authenticate API calls to the endpoints described on this page as delegated administrator or Microsoft Entra app.

> [!NOTE]  
> The API endpoints described on this page are supported from v2.20 of the Admin Center API.

## Request an environment transfer

Creates a request to transfer an environment to another Microsoft Entra tenant. 

> [!NOTE]  
> This API call must be authenticated on the source tenant.

```
POST /admin/v2.20/transfers/outgoing/applications/{applicationFamily}/environments/{environmentName}
```

### Route parameters

`applicationFamily` - Family of the environment's application as is. (for example, "BusinessCentral")
`environmentName` - Name of the environment

### Body

Specifies the Microsoft Entra tenant ID of the destination tenant and the date and time at which the transfer should run, if accepted on the destination tenant.

```
{
    "DestinationEntraTenantId": Guid, //The Microsoft Entra tenant ID of the destination tenant
