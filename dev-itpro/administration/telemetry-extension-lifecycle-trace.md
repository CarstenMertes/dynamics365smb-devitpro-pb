# Analyzing Extension Lifecycle Trace Telemetry

**INTRODUCED IN:** Business Central 2020 release wave 1, version 16.3. Extension-level support introduced in 2020 release wave 2, version 17.1.

[!INCLUDE[azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id](~/../shared-content/shared/azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id.md)]

Extension lifecycle telemetry gathers data about the success or failure of the following extension-related operations:

- Compiling an extension
- Synchronizing an extension
- Publishing an extension
- Installing an extension
- Updating an extension
- Uninstalling an extension
- Unpublishing an extension

Failed operations result in a trace log entry that includes a reason for the failure.

Traces are recorded for operations started initiated from any of the following components, depending whether you have Business Central online or on-premises:

|Component|Online|On-premises|
|---------|------|-----------|
|[Extension Management page](/dynamics365/business-central/ui-extensions) in the Business Central client.|![check mark for feature.](../developer/media/check.png)|![check mark for feature.](../developer/media/check.png)|

- [Extension Management page](/dynamics365/business-central/ui-extensions) in the Business Central client.
- [Manage Apps page](tenant-admin-center-manage-apps.md) in the Business Central admin center.
- [App Management](administration-center-api_app_management.md) of the Business Central admin center API.

<!--## Behavior overview

- Compiling, publishing, and unpublishing extensions

    Data for these operations is only recorded for extensions that are published in the tenant scope.

    - For on-premises, it includes extensions that are published by running the [Publish-NAVApp cmdlet](/powershell/module/microsoft.dynamics.nav.apps.management/publish-navapp) with the `-Scope Tenant` parameter.
    
    - For online, it includes per-tenant extensions uploaded from the **Extension Management** page in the client. It doesn't include Microsoft extensions or [AppSource extensions](https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-US/marketplace?product=dynamics-365-business-central).

- Synchronizing extensions

    - For on-premises, data for this operation is recorded when an extension is synchronized by using the [Sync-NAVApp cmdlet](/powershell/module/microsoft.dynamics.nav.apps.management/sync-navapp).

    - For online, data is recorded when an extension is installed from the **Extension Management** page in the client. Or, when upgraded from the [Manage Apps page](tenant-admin-center-manage-apps.md) in the Business Central administration center.

- Installing and uninstalling extensions

    - For on-premises, data for these operations is recorded when an extension is installed or uninstalled by using the [Install-NAVApp cmdlet](/powershell/module/microsoft.dynamics.nav.apps.management/install-navapp) or [Uninstall-NAVApp cmdlet](/powershell/module/microsoft.dynamics.nav.apps.management/uninstall-navapp). Or, when an extension is installed or uninstalled from the **Extension Management** page in the client.

    - For online, data for these operations is recorded when an extension is installed or uninstalled from the **Extension Management** page in the client.

- Updating an extension

    - For on-premises, data for this operation is recorded when an extension is upgraded by using the [Start-NAVAppDataUpgrade cmdlet](/powershell/module/microsoft.dynamics.nav.apps.management/start-navappdataupgrade).

    - For online, data is recorded when an extension is updated from the [Manage Apps page](tenant-admin-center-manage-apps.md) in the Business Central administration center.-->

> [!NOTE]
> For some operations, you might experience that certain custom dimensions aren't available. The reason is that custom dimensions are added to the signal gradually, as the information is retrieved. If the operation fails before the custom dimension is retrieved, it isn't included in the result. For example, if you try to uninstall an extension using the Ininstall-NAVApp cmdlet, and the specified extension name is wrong, the operation fails. In this case, the `extensionid` and `extensionVersion` will be excluded from the results.  

## ENVIRONMENT/SERVER TRACES

The traces in this section are recorded for extensions that are published to the environment/server in the tenant scope only.

- For on-premises, it includes extensions that are published by running the [Publish-NAVApp cmdlet](/powershell/module/microsoft.dynamics.nav.apps.management/publish-navapp) with the `-Scope Tenant` parameter.

- For online, it includes per-tenant extensions uploaded from the **Extension Management** page in the client. It doesn't include Microsoft extensions or [AppSource extensions](https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-US/marketplace?product=dynamics-365-business-central).

## <a name="compiledsuccess"></a>Extension compiled successfully

Occurs when an extension compiles successfully on the service. An extension compiles when it's published or when it's repaired by using the [Repair-NAVApp cmdlet](/powershell/module/microsoft.dynamics.nav.apps.management/repair-navapp).

### General dimensions

<a name="other"></a>**Common custom dimensions**

The following table explains custom dimensions that are common to all traces. 

|Dimension|Description or value|
|---------|-----|
|aadTenantId|Specifies the Microsoft Entra tenant ID used for Microsoft Entra authentication. For on-premises, if you aren't using Microsoft Entra authentication, this value is **common**. |

## TENANT TRACES

The traces in this section are recorded for synchronizing, installing and updating extensions on a tenant.

- Synchronizing extensions

    - For on-premises, data for this operation is recorded when an extension is synchronized by using the [Sync-NAVApp cmdlet](/powershell/module/microsoft.dynamics.nav.apps.management/sync-navapp).

    - For online, data is recorded when an extension is installed from the **Extension Management** page in the client. Or, when upgraded from the [Manage Apps page](tenant-admin-center-manage-apps.md) in the Business Central administration center.

- Installing and uninstalling extensions

    - For on-premises, data for these operations is recorded when an extension is installed or uninstalled by using the [Install-NAVApp cmdlet](/powershell/module/microsoft.dynamics.nav.apps.management/install-navapp) or [Uninstall-NAVApp cmdlet](/powershell/module/microsoft.dynamics.nav.apps.management/uninstall-navapp). Or, when an extension is installed or uninstalled from the **Extension Management** page in the client.

    - For online, data for these operations is recorded when an extension is installed or uninstalled from the **Extension Management** page in the client.

- Updating an extension

    - For on-premises, data for this operation is recorded when an extension is upgraded by using the [Start-NAVAppDataUpgrade cmdlet](/powershell/module/microsoft.dynamics.nav.apps.management/start-navappdataupgrade).

    - For online, data is recorded when an extension is updated from the [Manage Apps page](tenant-admin-center-manage-apps.md) in the Business Central administration center.

## CONTROL PLANE TRACES

[!INCLUDE[component](../developer/includes/online_only.md)]

The traces in this section are emitted by the Business Central control plane service during the installation or update operation of an extension/app. Theses traces compliment the tenant traces described above and help you identify the origin or cause of the extension's installation or update. The traces are recorded when:

- The extension is explicitly installed or updated
- The extension is installed or updated because an extension that's dependant on it was installed or updated.
- A hotfix is applied to the extension by Microsoft or ISV embed partner.

The following table illustrates the traces you can expect to see with the installation or update of an extension, in the order that they'll occur. The trace messages have been simplified for illustration purposes.

|Extension install lifecycle|Extension update lifecycle|Trace source|
|---------------------------|--------------------------|------------|
|Environment app version install scheduled|Environment app version update scheduled|Control plane|
|Environment app version install started|Environment app version update started|Control plane|
|Environment app version install/update requires dependency app| Environment app version install/update requires dependency app|Control plane|
|Extension synchronized: version|Extension synchronized: version|Tenant |
|Extension installed: version|Extension updated: version|Tenant |
|Environment app version installed|Environment app version updated|Control plane|

## <a name="app-install-scheduled"></a>Environment app version installation scheduled for environment

Occurs when scheduling the installation of a new extension/app has completed successfully.
