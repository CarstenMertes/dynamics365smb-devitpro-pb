# Analyzing Permission Changes Trace Telemetry

**APPLIES TO:** [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] 2020 release wave 2, version 17.2, and later

[!INCLUDE[azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id](~/../shared-content/shared/azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id.md)]

Permission changes telemetry gathers data about the following operations on permission sets: 

- A user-defined permission set was added or removed
- A link between a user-defined permission set and system permission set was added or removed
- A permission set was assigned to or removed from a user or user group
- A permission set was changed by an app/extension

For information about managing permission sets, see [Assign Permissions to Users and Groups](/dynamics365/business-central/ui-define-granular-permissions).

## <a name="setadded"></a>User-defined permission set added
