# Analyzing Permission Changes Trace Telemetry

**APPLIES TO:** [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] 2020 release wave 2, version 17.2, and later

[!INCLUDE[azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id](~/../shared-content/shared/azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id.md)]

Permission changes telemetry gathers data about the following operations on permission sets: 

- A user-defined permission set was added or removed
- A link between a user-defined permission set and system permission set was added or removed
- A permission set was assigned to or removed from a user or user group
- A permission set was changed by an app/extension

For information about managing permission sets, see [Assign Permissions to Users and Groups](/dynamics365/business-central/ui-define-granular-permissions).


## <a name="other"></a>Common custom dimensions

The following table explains custom dimensions that are common to all permission traces. 

|Dimension|Description or value|
|---------|-----|
|aadTenantId|Specifies the Microsoft Entra tenant ID used for Microsoft Entra authentication. For on-premises, if you aren't using Microsoft Entra authentication, this value is **common**. |
|alCategory|**AL PermissionSet**|
|alDataClassification|**SystemMetadata**|
|alObjectId|**1351**, which is the ID of the system application codeunit that subscribes to the telemetry events.|
|alObjectName|**Telemetry Subscribers**, which is the name of the system application codeunit that subscribes to the telemetry events.|
|alObjectType|**CodeUnit**|
|component|**Dynamics 365 Business Central Server**.|
|componentVersion|Specifies the version number of the component that emits telemetry (see the component dimension.)|
|environmentType|Specifies the environment type for the tenant, such as **Production**, **Sandbox**, **Trial**. See [Environment Types](tenant-admin-center-environments.md#types-of-environments).|
|telemetrySchemaVersion|Specifies the version of the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] telemetry schema.|

|Dimension|Description or value|
|---------|-----|
|message|**User-defined permission set added: {alPermissionSetId}**|

traces
| timestamp > ago(60d) // adjust as needed
| where customDimensions has 'AL0000E2A'
| where customDimensions.eventId == 'AL0000E2A'
| project timestamp
// in which environment/company did it happen
, aadTenantId = customDimensions.aadTenantId
, environmentName = customDimensions.environmentName
, environmentType = customDimensions.environmentType
, companyName = customDimensions.companyName
// what was changed
, alNumberOfUserDefinedPermissionSets = customDimensions.alNumberOfUserDefinedPermissionSets
, alPermissionSetId = customDimensions.alPermissionSetId
// which user did it
, usertelemetryId = case(
  toint( substring(customDimensions.componentVersion,0,2)) >= 20, user_Id // user telemetry ID was introduced in the platform in version 20.0
, 'N/A'
)
```
