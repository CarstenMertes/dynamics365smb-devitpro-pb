# Analyzing Authorization Trace Telemetry

[!INCLUDE[2019_releasewave2.md](../includes/2019_releasewave2.md)]

[!INCLUDE[azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id](~/../shared-content/shared/azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id.md)]

Authorization telemetry provides information about the authorization of users (or services) when trying to sign in to Business Central. This telemetry data can help you identify problems a user (or a service) might experience when signing in. 

Authorization signals are emitted in two stages of sign-in. The first stage is the initial authorization, before the CompanyOpen trigger is run. In this stage, the system verifies that the user account is enabled in the tenant and has the correct entitlements. The telemetry data includes:

- Success or failure of the sign-in attempt
- Reason for failure
- Type of user (such as normal, administrator, or delegated user)
- Whether the user belongs to the tenant or is an invited user

The next stage occurs after a successful authorization attempt, when trying to open the company (that is, when the CompanyOpen trigger run). The telemetry data indicates whether the company opened successfully or failed (for some reason).

> [!NOTE]
> Business Central 2020 release wave 1, version 16.1, introduces changes to some `operation_Name` and `message` dimension values. The differences from earlier versions are indicated in the following sections.

## Authorization Succeeded (Pre Open Company)

Occurs when a user has been successfully authorized. This data is not emitted for on-premises environments.

### General dimensions

## <a name="authorizationfailures"></a> Troubleshooting (Pre Open Company) authorization failures

### The user was successfully authenticated in Microsoft Entra ID but the user account is disabled in Business Central.

This message occurs when the user's account is valid, but the account is disabled. If you open the user account in Business Central, you'll see the **State** field is set to **Disabled**.

*Resolution*

Enable the user account by setting the **State** field to **Enabled**. For more information, see [Create Users According to Licenses](/dynamics365/business-central/ui-how-users-permissions).

### A user successfully authenticated in Microsoft Entra ID but the user does not have any entitlements in Business Central.

This message occurs if the user has an account, but the account hasn't been assigned any entitlements.

Entitlements are part of the license. Entitlements are permissions that describe which objects in Business Central a user can use, according to their Microsoft Entra role or license. For an explanation of entitlements, see [Business Central entitlements explained](https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/it/2019/07/18/business-central-entitlements/)

*Resolution*

Entitlements are assigned to the user account in the Microsoft 365 admin center or Microsoft Partner Center. They aren't assigned in Business Central. To assign entitlements to a user, see one of the following articles:

- From [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com), see [Add users individually or in bulk to Microsoft 365](/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/add-users).

- From the Microsoft Partner Center, see [User management tasks for customer accounts](/partner-center/assign-licenses-to-users).

### The user is not a direct/indirect member of the security group associated with the environment, or the group does not exist, hence restricting the user access to the environment

In Microsoft Entra ID, you can create security that include users that you want to give access to your environments. Then, from the Business Central Admin center, you can associate the groups with your environments. This error occurs if the user who tries to sign in isn't a member of the security group, or the security group assigned to the environment doesn't exist in Microsoft Entra ID. For more information, see [Managing Production and Sandbox Environments in the Admin Center](tenant-admin-center-environments.md).

## Authorization Succeeded (Open Company)

## <a name="opencompanyfailures"></a>Troubleshooting (Open Company) authorization failures

### The company name is not valid, because the name is either empty or exceeds the maximum allowed length.

This message occurs when a user tries to sign in to a company whose name exceeds the maximum allowed length.

*Resolution*

This message typically occurs when a user tries to access a specific company in Business Center by entering a URL in the browser address, for example, `https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?company=CRONUS%20International%20Ltd.`. If the name exceeds 30 characters, then this message occurs. Make sure that the user has the proper name of the company.

### The user does not have permission to access the company.

This message occurs when a user account in Business Central doesn't have the proper permissions to the company.

*Resolution*

In Business Central, open the user account and modify the permissions the user to give them access to the company. For more information, see [Assign Permissions to Users and Groups](/dynamics365/business-central/ui-define-granular-permissions).

> [!TIP]
> A good starting point is to look at the **Effective Permissions** that the user has on the company. You can do this from the user card by selecting **Effective Permissions** and setting the **Company** to the company in question.

### The company doesn't exist.

This message occurs when a user tries to sign in to a company, but the company isn't found in Business Central.

*Resolution*

This message typically occurs when a user tries to access a specific company in Business Center by entering a URL in the browser address, for example, `https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?company=CRONUS%20International%20Ltd.`. Make sure that the user has the proper name of the company.

### User cannot open the company because the tenant is locked.

This message indicates that the tenant has been locked by Microsoft, typically for security reasons like preventing repeated malicious sign-in attempts. The tenant isn't accessible by any user.

*Resolution*

For help with resolving this issue, read the following articles or contact Microsoft Support: 

- [Troubleshoot account lockout problems with a Microsoft Entra ID Domain Services managed domain](/azure/active-directory-domain-services/troubleshoot-account-lockout)

- ["It looks like your account has been blocked" error when signing in to Microsoft 365](/office365/troubleshoot/access-management/account-blocked-error-when-sign-in)

### The user can't sign in to the company because the assigned license has expired or the trial period has ended.

This message occurs for one the following reasons:

- The license being used has expired.
- The license was trial license and the trial period has ended. Trial licenses are typically assigned when customers subscribe for an evaluation version by using self-service sign-up (also known as IW or viral sign-up). This license has a time limit.

*Resolution*

Renew the existing license or obtain a new license. Licenses are purchased through the Cloud Solution Provider (CSP)
program. For more information, see the [Cloud Service Provider site](https://partner.microsoft.com/cloud-solution-provider) and the [Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central Licensing Guide](https://download.microsoft.com/download/D/A/4/DA497449-9805-42DC-91F5-A857295C233D/Dynamics%20365%20Business%20Central%20Licensing%20Guide%20Oct%202019.pdf).

### You can't open the company, because it is a production company. Your license isn't valid for use on production companies.

This message occurs because the license doesn't allow the user to open production companies. For example, the user may be using a trial license that is only valid on the evaluation version.

*Resolution*

Obtain a license that can be used on production companies. Licenses are purchased through the Cloud Solution Provider (CSP)
program. For more information, see the [Cloud Service Provider site](https://partner.microsoft.com/cloud-solution-provider) and the [Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central Licensing Guide](https://download.microsoft.com/download/D/A/4/DA497449-9805-42DC-91F5-A857295C233D/Dynamics%20365%20Business%20Central%20Licensing%20Guide%20Oct%202019.pdf).

### Error in OnOpenCompany trigger

This message occurs when AL code causes an error during the OnOpenCompany trigger or event.

*Resolution*

Because AL code can trigger any type of error, the resolution will depend on the executed AL code. See the **failureReason** dimension for a callstack to determine where the error occurred.
