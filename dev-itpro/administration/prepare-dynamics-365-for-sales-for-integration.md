# Preparing Dynamics 365 Sales for Integration

This article describes how to set up and configure [!INCLUDE[crm_md](../developer/includes/crm_md.md)] for integrating with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)]. Complete the following tasks:  

1.  Create a user for connecting to and synchronizing data from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)].  


2.  Install the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] integration solution for [!INCLUDE[crm_md](../developer/includes/crm_md.md)].  

     This task is optional. You only need to complete this task if you want the functionality that is provided by the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] integration solution.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  To perform the tasks in this topic, you must have the System Administrator security role or equivalent privileges in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](../developer/includes/crm_md.md)].  

##  <a name="createuser"></a> Create a Dynamics 365 for Sales User for Connecting to Business Central
  
 As a minimum, this user must be a non-interactive user account that has the required privileges to write, read, modify, and delete data in the entities that will be integrated with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)].  

 You will use this user account to set up the connection to [!INCLUDE[crm_md](../developer/includes/crm_md.md)] from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)].  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  You should not use this account to sign in to [!INCLUDE[crm_md](../developer/includes/crm_md.md)] to modify entities records that are integrated with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] because the changes will be ignored by integration synchronization jobs in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)].

#### Create the connection user  

-   For more information about how to create users in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](../developer/includes/crm_md.md)], see [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=616518](/previous-versions/dynamicscrm-2016/administering-dynamics-365/dn531066(v=crm.8)).  

##  <a name="InstallNavSolution"></a> Install the Business Central Integration Solution
  
 [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] includes a solution that enables users to access coupled records in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)], such as customers and items, from records in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](../developer/includes/crm_md.md)], such as accounts and products. The solution adds a link on the [!INCLUDE[crm_md](../developer/includes/crm_md.md)] record pages that opens the coupled [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] record. The solution is also used to display information from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] in a part on certain entity records in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](../developer/includes/crm_md.md)], such as accounts. Installing this solution is optional.  


1.  From [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] installation media \(DVD\), copy either the  DynamicsNAVIntegrationSolution_v8.zip or DynamicsNAVIntegrationSolution_v9.zip file to your computer.  

    These files are located in the **CrmCustomization** folder. This file is the solution package.

    Use the zip version that matches the [!INCLUDE[crm_md](../developer/includes/crm_md.md)] SDK version. Use DynamicsNAVIntegrationSolution_v8.zip for legacy services running CRM or [!INCLUDE[crm_md](../developer/includes/crm_md.md)] version 8.x and earlier. Use DynamicsNAVIntegrationSolution_v9.zip for [!INCLUDE[crm_md](../developer/includes/crm_md.md)] versions 9.0 and later. 

2.  In [!INCLUDE[crm_md](../developer/includes/crm_md.md)], import the DynamicsNAVIntegrationSolution.zip as a solution.  

     This step adds the **Business Central Connection** entity and **Business Central Account Statistics** entity in the system and additional items such as Business Central integration security roles.  

     For more information about how to manage solutions in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](../developer/includes/crm_md.md)], [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=616519](/previous-versions/dynamicscrm-2016/administering-dynamics-365/dn531198(v=crm.8)).  

3.  (Optional) Set up the **Business Central Connection** entity to display in the **Settings** area of [!INCLUDE[crm_md](../developer/includes/crm_md.md)].  

     This setup enables [!INCLUDE[crm_md](../developer/includes/crm_md.md)] users who are assigned the **Business Central Admin** role to modify the entity in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](../developer/includes/crm_md.md)]. For more information about how to modify entities in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](../developer/includes/crm_md.md)], see [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=616521](/previous-versions/dynamicscrm-2016/admins-customizers-dynamics-365/mt826673(v=crm.8)).  

4.  Assign the **Business Central Integration Administrator** role to the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] connection user.  

5.  Assign the **Business Central Integration User** role to all users who require the use of the features provided by the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] integration solution.  

If you install the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] integration solution after you have set up the connection to [!INCLUDE[crm_md](../developer/includes/crm_md.md)] from in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)], you must modify the connection setup to point to the URL of the [!INCLUDE[nav_web_md](../developer/includes/nav_web_md.md)].<!-- For more information, see [How to: Set Up a Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Sales Connection]() -->
