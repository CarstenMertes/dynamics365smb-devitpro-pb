# Preparing Your Network for the Excel Add-In

As the administrator of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] online or on-premises, you can deploy an add-in so that users can work with their [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] data in the Excel desktop app. This article includes information that helps administrators configure advanced device and network settings for the Excel add-in for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] when your network requirements block the add-in.  

## Network endpoints required by the Excel add-in

The Excel add-in must have access to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] for it to function and synchronize business data. Network services, such as proxies or firewalls, must allow routing between each client device on which the add-in is installed and the following services that are published by Microsoft:

- `https://az689774.vo.msecnd.net`
- `https://dc.services.visualstudio.com`
- `https://exceladdinprovider.smb.dynamics.com`
- `https://api.businesscentral.dynamics.com`

> [!NOTE]
> Your API endpoint URL can be different from these default values. For example, if your environment is based on a vertical solution by Fabrikam, your API endpoint is `https://fabrikam.api.bc.dynamics.com`. These vertical solutions have API endpoints that are based on the format of *`ApplicationName`.api.bc.dynamics.com*. You can check if an environment uses such a URL in the [Business Central Administration Center](tenant-admin-center.md).
