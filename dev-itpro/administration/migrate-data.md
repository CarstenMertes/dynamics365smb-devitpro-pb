# Migrate on-premises data to Business Central Online

Organizations that run their workloads on-premises but are looking to move to the cloud can easily migrate to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] online. By moving to the cloud, users get the benefits of cloud scenarios such as Machine Learning, Power BI, and Power Automate to drive suggested actions.  

If you're not familiar with [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] online, learn more in [Business Central trials and subscriptions](/dynamics365/business-central/across-preview?toc=/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/toc.json).

## Supported migration paths

[!INCLUDE [bc-cloud-products](../includes/bc-cloud-products.md)]

If a customer is coming from another product, you can use configuration packages and templates to migrate their data to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises. After that, use the cloud migration tool to switch to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] online. For more information, go to [Set Up Company Configuration Packages](set-up-standard-company-configuration-packages.md).  

> [!TIP]
> Customers coming from QuickBooks can use apps from Microsoft to move to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] online. For more information, go to [Changing from a QuickBooks App to Dynamics 365 Business Central](/dynamics365/business-central/across-quickbooks-to-business-edition).
