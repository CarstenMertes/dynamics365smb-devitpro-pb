# Analyze email telemetry

**APPLIES TO:** [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] 2020 release wave 2, update 17.2, and later

Email telemetry gathers data about the following operations: 

- An email was sent successfully
- An attempt to send an email failed 

From [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] 2023 release wave 1, update 23.2, and later, the following operations are also emitted to telemetry:

- Authentication to an SMTP server succeded/failed
- Connection to an SMTP server succeded/failed


<!--Today, partners can test email setup during setup (click a test button). If settings change on SMTP side later, they don't get notified before something stops working. -->

Before you can collect this data, you'll have to set up email. For more information, see [Set Up Email](/dynamics365/business-central/admin-how-setup-email) in the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] application help.

> [!TIP]
> You can also view failed emails in the **Email Outbox** page in the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] client.


## <a name="success"></a>Email sent successfully

Occurs when an email was successfully sent from the client.

```kql
traces

| where  customDimensions.eventId == 'AL0000CTP'
     or (customDimensions.eventId == 'AL0000GKK' and customDimensions.alAuthenticated == 'No')

     or (customDimensions.eventId == 'AL0000GKL' and customDimensions.alSent == 'No')
| extend EventId = customDimensions.eventId     
| summarize count() by
  aadTenantId = tostring( customDimensions.aadTenantId )
, environmentName = tostring( customDimensions.environmentName )
, environmentType = tostring( customDimensions.environmentType )
, companyName = tostring( customDimensions.companyName )
, clientType = tostring( customDimensions.clientType )
, ErrorType = case (
  EventId == 'AL0000CTP', 'Other'
, EventId == 'AL0000GKK', 'SMTP authentication'
