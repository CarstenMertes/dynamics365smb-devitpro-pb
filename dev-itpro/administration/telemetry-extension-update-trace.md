# Analyzing Extension Update Telemetry

**INTRODUCED IN:** Exception telemetry was introduced in Business Central 2020 release wave 1, version 16.2. Upgrade tag telemetry was introduced in Business Central 2021 release wave 1, version 18.1.

[!INCLUDE[azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id](~/../shared-content/shared/azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id.md)]

Extension upgrade telemetry gathers information about operations that can occur during extension upgrades:

- Upgrade code failures

    The telemetry provides information about exceptions that are thrown by code run by upgrade codeunits. The trace events include the following information:

    - The codeunit that threw the exception.
    - AL stack trace.
    - Exception message.

- Upgrade tag usage

    The telemetry provides information about calls to the AL methods `HasUpgradeTag` and `SetUpgradeTag` from upgrade codeunits. These methods are provided by codeunit **9999 Upgrade Tag** in the System Application extension. Upgrade tags are used to control when upgrade code is run. For more information, see [Using upgrade tags to control upgrade code](../developer/devenv-upgrading-extensions.md#using-upgrade-tags-to-control-upgrade-code). This data can help you identify, troubleshoot, and resolve issues in upgrade code.

The telemetry helps you troubleshoot and resolve code issues that block the data upgrade of per-tenant and AppSource extensions.

## Extension Update Failed: exception raised in extension

Occurs when an extension upgrade fails because of an exception in an upgrade codeunit.  

### General dimensions

|Dimension|Description or value|
|---------|-----|
|message|**Extension Update Failed: exception raised in extension {extensionName} by {extensionPublisher} (updating to version {extensionTargetedVersion})**|
|severityLevel|**3**|

### Custom dimensions

|Dimension|Description or value|
|---------|-----|
|eventId|**RT0010**|
|alObjectId|The ID of the AL object that was run by request|
|alStackTrace|The stack trace in AL|
|companyName|The display name of the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] company that was used at time of execution |
|extensionName|The name of the extension that was being upgraded|
|extensionId|The AppID of the extension that was being upgraded|
|extensionTargetedVersion|The new version of the extension being upgraded|
|extensionVersion|The old version of the extension being upgraded|
|failureReason|The exception that was thrown by the upgrade code. Some exception messages can contain customer data. As a precaution, Business Central only emits information that's classified as [SystemMetadata](../developer/devenv-classifying-data.md). Exception messages that contain other data classifications, like customer data, aren't shown. Instead, the following message is shown: "Message not shown because the NavBaseException(string, Exception, bool) constructor was used."|
|failureType|**DataUpdate**|

<a name="other"></a>**Common custom dimensions**

The following table explains other custom dimensions that are common to all extension update traces.

|Dimension|Description or value|
|---------|-----|
|aadTenantId|The Microsoft Entra tenant ID that's used for Microsoft Entra authentication. For on-premises, if you aren't using Microsoft Entra authentication, this value is **common**. |
|component|**Dynamics 365 Business Central Server**|
|componentVersion|The version number of the component that emits telemetry (see the component dimension)|
|environmentName|The name of the tenant environment. See [Managing Environments](tenant-admin-center-environments.md). This dimension isn't included for [!INCLUDE[prod_short.md](../includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises environments.|
|deprecatedKeys|A comma-separated list of all the keys that have been deprecated. The keys in this list are still supported but will eventually be removed in the next major release. We recommend that update any queries that use these keys to use the new key name.|
|environmentType|The environment type for the tenant, such as **Production**, **Sandbox**, **Trial**. See [Environment Types](tenant-admin-center-environments.md#types-of-environments)|
|telemetrySchemaVersion|The version of the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] telemetry schema|

## Upgrade tag searched for

Occurs when the `HasUpgradeTag` method in codeunit **9999 Upgrade Tag** is called from an upgrade codeunit during an extension upgrade.

### General dimensions

|Dimension|Description or value|
|---------|-----|
|message|**Upgrade tag searched for: {alUpgradeTag}**|
|severityLevel|**3**|

### Custom dimensions

|Dimension|Description or value|
|---------|-----|
|eventId|**AL0000EJ9**|
|alCategory|**ALUpgrade**|
|alCompanyName|The display name of the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] company that was used at time of execution |
|alDataClassification|**OrganizationIdentifiableInformation**|
|alObjectId|**9996**|
|alObjectName|**Upgrade Tag Impl.**|
|alUpgradeTag| The upgrade tag that was input to the `HasUpgradeTag` method |
|alExecutionContext| The context that the upgrade code was running in. The dimension has the following values:<ul><li> **Install** indicates the code was run during the installation of the extension.</li><li>**Upgrade** indicates the code was run during the upgrade of the extension.</li><li>**Normal** indicates the code was run by an operation other than extension installation or upgrade. For example, when a new company was added.</li></ul>|
|alValue| **true** if the upgrade tag was found; otherwise, **false**.  |
|extensionName|**System Application**|
|extensionId|The ID of the **System Application** extension|
|extensionPublisher|The publisher of the **System Application** extension|
|extensionVersion|The version of the **System Application** extension|
