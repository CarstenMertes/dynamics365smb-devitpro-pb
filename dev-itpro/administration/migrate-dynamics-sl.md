# Dynamics SL data migrated to Business Central online

This article provides an overview of the Dynamics SL data that can be migrated to Business Central online by cloud migration tools. You configure the actual data to migrate either globally or per company as part of the cloud migration setup using the **SL Company Migration Configuration** page.

## Fiscal periods

The **GL Setup** > **Fiscal Info** periods in Dynamics SL migrate to Business Central as *accounting periods*. Years marked as *historical* in Dynamics SL come over to Business Central as *open* and must be closed in Business Central. Adjustments to historical years can be made before closing the year.

## Chart of Accounts master records

The account number in Business Central maps from the account in Dynamics SL. The Dynamics SL subaccount segments are defined as *dimensions* in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)]. The **SL Company Migration Configuration** asks you to enter a segment for *Global Dimension 1* and *Global Dimension 2*. If your Dynamics SL subaccount has more than two segments outside of the main segment, the other segments are automatically set up as shortcut dimensions (3-8). Verify the setup in the **General Ledger Setup** page in Business Central. Learn more about dimensions in [Work with dimensions](/dynamics365/business-central/finance-dimensions). 

Consider the following account from Dynamics SL that uses the year 2022 as an example:

The migration creates two accounts in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)], number 1100 and number 4000. New dimensions are also added with the names 00, and 01. General journal transactions are created as follows:

|Transaction date |Account No.|Amount  |Dimensions|
|-----------------|-----------|--------|----------|
|1/31/2022        |1100   |250.00 |Dimension 00, 00|
|1/31/2022        |1100   |240.00 |Dimension 00, 01|
|1/31/2022        |4000   |490.00 |Dimension 00, 00|
|2/28/2022        |1100   |117.00 |Dimension 00, 00|
|2/28/2022        |1100   |102.00 |Dimension 00, 01|
|2/28/2022        |4000   |219.00 |Dimension 00, 00|
|3/31/2022        |1100   |340.00 |Dimension 00, 00|
|3/31/2022        |1100   |501.00 |Dimension 00, 01|
|3/31/2022        |4000   |841.00 |Dimension 00, 00|

The data migration generates dimensions on that account based on the different subaccount segments. Users see a *Department* dimension with the values *00*, *10*, and *20*, respectively. A second dimension, *Division*, shows the values *00*, *01*, and *02*, respectively.

The General ledger (GL) account summary transactions are generated and posted for open and history years that were set up in Dynamics SL. The summary amounts are created based on the fiscal periods set up in Dynamics SL. In the **SL Company Migration Configuration** page, you can select the oldest historical year you want migrated to Business Central. For example, if 2019, 2020, and 2021 are historical years in Dynamics SL, you could select that the oldest historical year you want migrated is 2020. Summary transactions for 2019 wouldn't be migrated to Business Central.

## Customer master records and outstanding transactions from the Receivables module

In the **SL Company Migration Configuration** page, choose to migrate all customers from Dynamics SL or only active customers. This action lets you exclude customers marked as inactive. All customer addresses are also brought over into Business Central and set up as shipping addresses. This setup allows the end user to choose the needed address when entering transactions after the migration.

The posting group created by the SL Migration is called **SL**.

We also bring over outstanding receivables transactions. These transactions are brought in with the amount remaining in Dynamics SL. For example, if an invoice for $1000 was entered into Dynamics SL, and it has been partially paid and has a remaining balance of $400, the new invoice created in Business Central is for $600 because that's the amount remaining to be paid. We bring over all transaction types from Receivables Management.

## Vendor master records and outstanding transactions from the Payables module

In the **SL Company Migration Configuration** page, choose to migrate all vendors from Dynamics SL or only active vendors. This action lets you exclude vendors marked as inactive. All vendor addresses are brought over into Business Central. The vendor's **Remit To Address** is set to the main address, and all other addresses are set up as **Order** addresses. This setup allows the end user to choose the needed address when entering transactions after the migration.

Posting group created by the SL Migration tool is called **SL**.

We also bring over outstanding Payables transactions. These transactions are brought in with the amount remaining in Dynamics SL. For example, if an invoice for $1000 was entered into Dynamics SL, and it has been partially paid and has a remaining balance of $400, the new invoice created in Business Central is for $600 because that's the amount remaining to be paid. We bring over all transaction types from Payables Management.

## Inventory items

Inventory is imported with the cost valuation method that is set in Dynamics SL at the time the migration is run. Location information and the quantity on hand for each Item is migrated. If serial or lot information is tracked on an Item, that information is also migrated.  

Posting group created by the SL Migration tool is called “SL”

On the **SL Company Migration Configuration** page, you can choose to migrate historical information from Dynamics SL into Business Central. This migrated data is then visible in list pages found under the corresponding entities and navigating to **Dynamics SL Detail Snapshot**. You can indicate if you want to migrate GL detail, Receivables, Payables, Sales Order Processing, Purchase Order Receipts, and Inventory transactions. The data is stored in extension tables in Business Central. Data stored in those tables can be used in Power BI reports, Power Apps, or other non-Microsoft reporting tools. The tables containing the SL Historical Snapshot data are as follows:

- SL Hist. Batch
- SL Hist. GLTran
- SL Hist. APDoc
- SL Hist. APTran
- SL Hist. APAdjust
- SL Hist. APDoc
- SL Hist. APTran
- SL Hist. APAdjust
- SL Hist. INTran
- SL Hist. PurchOrd
- SL Hist. PurOrdDet
- SL Hist. POReceipt
- SL Hist. POTran
- SL Hist. SOHeader
- SL Hist. SOLine
- SL Hist. SOShipHeader
- SL Hist. SOShipLine
- SL Hist. SOType

You can limit the data migrated in the snapshot by entering the latest year in SL that you want to bring over. Enter this year in the **Oldest Snapshot Year** field on the **SL Company Migration Configuration** page.  

The **SL Historical Snapshot** runs as a background process after the migration is complete. The status of the SL Historical Snapshot data can be viewed in Fact boxes on the **Cloud Migration Management** page.
