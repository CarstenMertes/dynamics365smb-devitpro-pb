# Configure Dynamics SL company migration

The Business Central cloud migration tools for Dynamics SL include the **SL Company Migration Configuration** page. This page allows you to make global settings for all companies selected to migrate with the ability to update at a company level if necessary. For more information about the data that can be migrated, see [Dynamics SL data migrated to Business Central online](migrate-dynamics-SL.md).

Complete this task after you set up cloud migration and before you replicate data.

For an overview of the full end-to-end process for Dynamics SL cloud migration, go [here](migrate-sl-overview.md#end-to-end-process).
 
## Prerequisites

[Run cloud migration setup](migration-setup-SL.md).

## Get started

The **SL Company Migration Configuration** page opens automatically when you complete the **Cloud Migration Setup** assisted setup. You can also open the page by searching for and opening the **Cloud Migration Management** page and then selecting the **SL Company Migration Configuration** action.

Once you have the **SL Company Migration Configuration** open, you can start to configure what data to migrate by using the different sections of the page. The page enables you to configure the migration globally for all companies that you choose to migrate (using the upper sections of the page) or on a per-company basis using the **Per Company** section.

You don't necessarily have to make any changes on this page. However, you're required to make changes if there's more than one subaccount segment in Dynamics SL because you must indicate which subaccount segment to use for the global dimensions. And as best practice, you should specify how many years back to migrate data, otherwise the tool migrates all years. Whether or not you make changes, we recommend that you review the default settings before you close the page and continue the migration process.

## Configure migration globally

The steps in this section configure the data migration globally for all companies that you chose to migrate using the **Cloud Migration Setup**. If you're migrating more than one company, you can specify the [configuration on a per-company basis](#configure-migration-per-company).

1. **Set the dimensions**.

   To assign default dimensions for the companies you're migrating, select the **Dimension 1** and **Dimension2** values in the **Per Company** for each company you're migrating. You must go to the **Per Company** section of the page and set the dimensions manually for these companies. **Dimension 1** and **Dimension2** are selected from the Dynamics SL subaccount segments. that you want to use as the global dimensions in Business Central. The remaining segments are automatically set up as shortcut dimensions.  [Learn more about Dimensions](/dynamics365/business-central/finance-dimensions).

1. **Modules**: Choose the modules to migrate.

   Use the **Modules** section to choose the specific modules you want to migrate data from to Business Central. By default, all modules are selected for migration. If you don't want to migrate data for a module, turn off its switch. For example, if you don't want to migrate data for payables, turn off the **Payables** switch.

   If you're migrating the General Ledger module, be sure to go to the **Per Company** section and specify the **Oldest GL Year** field. The year and all future years are migrated to Business Central. If you don't set the **Oldest GL Year** field, all years are migrated.

1. **Master Data Only**: Choose whether to migrate master data only for modules.

   Use the **Master data only** section to specify those modules for which you only want to migrate master data. For example, if you only want to migrate Vendors, turn on the **Payables**. Transactions aren't migrated in this case.

   By default, both master data and transactional data for the selected modules are migrated. Master data represents the core information about entities that change infrequently, for example, information about a vendor. Transactional data captures specific activities or events for an entity, like open vendor documents.

1. **Disable Auto Posting**: Choose whether to disable auto posting for migrated transactions for the modules listed.

   By default, the migration process automatically posts migrated transactions in batches based on the type. Use the **Disable Auto Posting** section to specify transactions that you don't want to be posted automatically. To disable auto posting, turn off the switch.

   Disabling auto posting is useful if you wanted to modify transactions before they're posted. For example, if you wanted to adjust some **General Ledger** accounts before they're posted, turn off the **Account batches** switch.

1. **Inactive Records**: Choose the inactive record or discontinued items that you want to migrate.

   Use the **Inactive records** section to specify the inactive records or discontinued items that you want to migrate. By default, no inactive records or discontinued items are migrated. So, for example, if you want to migrate inactive customers, turn on the **Inactive Customers** switch.

1. **Classes**: Choose the classes that you want to migrate as posting groups.

   This is a future feature to use **Classes** to create posting groups, but is currently not available in the Dynamics SL Migration Tool

1. **Historical Snapshots**: Choose the historical transactions that you want to migrate.

   Use the **Historical Snapshots** section to specify historical transactions that you want to migrate to Business Central. The selected transactions are migrated to extension tables in Business Central. Users in the Business Central client can then view the data from specific Dynamics SL list pages.

   To migrate historical transactions, use the following steps.
   1. Turn on the **Enable/Disable All Transactions** switch.
   1. Turn on the switch for each transaction type you want to migrate, like **GL Transactions** and **AR Transactions**.
   1. Go to the **Per Company** section and set **Oldest Snapshot Year** field the earliest year in Dynamics SL that you want to be migrated.

## Configure migration per company

Use the **Per Company** section to set the data migration settings separately for each company when you're migrating more than one company. You can specify the same settings as you can globally, plus a couple more. By default, each company uses the global settings.

Use the following fields to specify how far back in time you want to migrate general ledger (GL) account summary data and historical snapshots:

- **Oldest GL Year** - Use this field to select from which year in the past you want to migrate GL account summary transactions. If the **Oldest GL Year** field is empty, all years are migrated. Account summary transactions are generated and posted for open and history years that are set up in Dynamics SL. The summary amounts are created based on the fiscal periods set up in Dynamics SL. For example, suppose 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022 are historical years in Dynamics SL, but you only wanted to migrate data from 2021 and later. In this case, you set the **Oldest GL Year** to 2021. As a result, summary transactions for 2019 and 2020 aren't migrated to Business Central.

- **Oldest Snapshot Year** - Use this field to select from which year in the past you want to migrate history snapshots. If the **Oldest GL Year** field is empty, history snapshots from all years are migrated.
