# Using table partitioning and data compression

The use of SQL Server table/index partitioning and data compression are supported configurations for on-premises installations of the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] database. 

## <a name="TablePartitioning"></a>Using SQL Server table partitioning

The data of partitioned tables and indexes is divided into units that can be spread across more than one filegroup in a SQL Server database. All partitions of a single index or table must be in the same database. The table or index is treated as a single logical entity when queries or updates are done on the data.

Partitioning large tables or indexes can have the following manageability and performance benefits:

- You can do maintenance operations on one or more partitions more quickly. The operations are more efficient because they target only these data subsets, instead of the whole table. For example, you can choose to rebuild one or more partitions of an index.
- You can possibly improve query performance, based on the types of queries you frequently run and on your hardware configuration. When SQL Server does data sorting for I/O operations, it sorts the data first by partition. SQL Server accesses one drive at a time, which might reduce performance. To improve data sorting performance, stripe the data files of your partitions across more than one disk by setting up a RAID (redundant array of independent disks). In this way, although SQL Server still sorts data by partition, it can access all the drives of each partition at the same time.
- You can use partitioning to distribute parts of tables to different IO sub systems. For example, you could archive data for old transactions on slow and less expensive disks and keep current data on solid-state drives (SSD).
You can improve performance by enabling lock escalation at the partition level instead of a whole table. Doing so may also reduce lock contention on the table.

For more general information about partitioned tables and indexes in SQL Server, see [Partitioned Tables and Indexes](/sql/relational-databases/partitions/partitioned-tables-and-indexes).

### How [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] supports partitioning

In the application code, you create a table object that you want partitioned just like any other table. The only requirement is that the partitioning field is defined in the primary key of the table object. The partitioning of the table is done in SQL Server on the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] database by using SQL Server Management Studio or Transact-SQL. For partitioning to work, the partitioning column (field) must be part of the clustering key on the table in SQL.

After a table in the database has been altered to make them partitioned tables, the synchronization engine, which is responsible for mapping the logical metamodel to physical tables, will respect this configuration during upgrades. After a schema upgrade, even if tables were dropped and recreated, the partitioning strategy that's applied to the original tables will be added to the upgraded tables.

#### Considerations and limitations

With tables defined in AL extensions, you shouldn't add fields to primary key definitions once the extension has been published and synchronized with any production databases. Changing the primary key is considered a breaking schema change. If you change a primary key, the new extension version can't be synchronized with the databases, so upgrading to the new version isn't possible.

This condition limits the possibilities of partitioning tables in Microsoft extensions, like the system and base applications. In practice, this constraint means that partitioning is primarily limited to tables in new custom extensions or tables in existing extensions that already include the partitioning fields in the primary keys. So it's important when developing new tables that you design for partitioning from the start by including the partitioning fields in the primary key. 

> [!NOTE]
> This constraint doesn't apply to CAL-based tables developed in C/SIDE with Business Central version 14 and earlier.

<!--
With CAL

You can only partition tables that belong to custom extensions. You can't partition tables that belong to Microsoft extension, like the system application or base application.  

If you have altered tables in a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] database to make them partitioned tables, the synchronization engine, which is responsible for mapping the logical metamodel to physical tables, will respect this configuration during upgrades. After a schema upgrade, even if tables were dropped and recreated, the partitioning strategy that's applied to the original tables will be added to the upgraded tables.

### How to choose a good partitioning strategy

Choosing the right partitioning strategy for a table depends on the data distribution, data growth patterns, and the way data is queried. SQL optimizer uses a technique called *partition elimination* to improve performance by accessing only partitions that are needed to satisfy the query's filter criteria. For SQL optimizer to use partition elimination, the partition key must be present as a predicate in the WHERE clause of the SQL statement it needs to prepare an execution plan for. For tables such as ledgers, a data partition strategy that uses dates can be used to eliminate historical data from queries. For tables that have state, like a status field, and a highly skewed distribution with one or two end states as the majority, a strategy that partitions on the state field might be a good choice.

Data partitioning is a commonly used technique in data warehouses. Including the words “data warehouse” in an internet search for partitioning examples might help finding a strategy that matches your needs.

### Table partitioning example

This example uses Transact-SQL to change a table to be a partitioned table. Suppose you're creating a new AL extension that includes a table object named **My Ledger Entry**, similar to the **G_L Entry** table object in the Microsoft base application. The table has a primary key that includes the **Entry No_** field. The table also includes a **Posting Date** field that you want to partition the table on.

The following steps will partition the table on the**Posting Date** field, with data partitioned on the year, and where all partitions are aligned to the PRIMARY file group:

1. In application code, add the **Posting Date** field to the table's primary key.
2. Publish and install the extension on the tenant.
3. In SQL query editor, create a partition function that creates partitions that divide on year. This function can be used for partitioning multiple tables:

    ```sql
    CREATE PARTITION FUNCTION [DataHistoryPartitionmethod] (datetime)
    AS RANGE LEFT FOR VALUES (
    '20151231 23:59:59.997',
    '20161231 23:59:59.997',
    '20171231 23:59:59.997',
    '20181231 23:59:59.997'  )
    GO
    ```

4. Create a partition scheme that maps partitions to file groups. In this example, all partitions are mapped to the PRIMARY file group. This scheme can be used for partitioning multiple tables:

    ```sql
    CREATE PARTITION SCHEME DataHistoryPartitionScheme
    AS PARTITION DataHistoryPartitionmethod ALL TO ([PRIMARY])
    GO
    ```

5. In the Transact-SQL Editor, partition table **My Ledger Entry** by using the previously defined partition scheme.

    For illustration purposes, the extension ID in this example is `$11111111-aaaa-2222-bbbb-333333333333`.
    
    ```sql
    ALTER TABLE [dbo].[CRONUS International Ltd_$My Ledger Entry$11111111-aaaa-2222-bbbb-333333333333]  
    DROP CONSTRAINT [CRONUS International Ltd_$My Ledger Entry$11111111-aaaa-2222-bbbb-333333333333$Key1]
    GO
    
    ALTER TABLE [dbo].[CRONUS International Ltd_$My Ledger Entry$11111111-aaaa-2222-bbbb-333333333333]
    ADD CONSTRAINT [CRONUS International Ltd_$My Ledger Entry$11111111-aaaa-2222-bbbb-333333333333$Key1] PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED
    (
    -- Include all fields that are in the clustered index definition. Don't add or omit any fields.
    [Entry No_], [Posting Date]
    )
    -- Tells SQL Server how the partitioning is done:
    ON DataHistoryPartitionScheme( [Posting Date] )
    GO
    ```

> [!TIP]
> SQL Server Management Studio includes the **Create Partition Wizard** to help you create partitioning functions, partitioning schemes, as well as changing a table to be partitioned. For more information, see [Create Partitioned Tables and Indexes](/sql/relational-databases/partitions/create-partitioned-tables-and-indexes).

## <a name="Compression"></a>Using SQL Server data compression

Since [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] April 2019, it's possible to configure data compression directly in table metadata by using the [CompressionType property](../developer/properties/devenv-compressiontype-property.md). Previously, compression could only be configured in SQL Server. You use data compression to help reduce the size of selected tables in the database. Besides saving space, data compression can help improve performance of I/O-intensive workloads because the data is stored in fewer pages and queries will read fewer pages from disk. So data compression is especially useful if your storage system is based on disks and not SSD.

However, extra CPU resources are required on the database server to compress and decompress the data while data is exchanged with the [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)].

With the **CompressionType** property, you can configure row or page type compression or configure the table not to use compression. With these compression settings, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] table synchronization process will make changes to the SQL Server table, overwriting the current compression type, if any. You can choose to control data compression directly on SQL Server by setting the **CompressionType** property to **Unspecified**, in which case table synchronization process won't control the data compression.

> [!NOTE]
> In the online version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)], tables are compressed with **CompressionType** set to **Page**.

To evaluate whether a table is a good candidate to compress, you can use the stored procedure `sp_estimate_data_compression_savings` in SQL Server. For more information, see [sp_estimate_data_compression_savings (Transact-SQL)](/sql/relational-databases/system-stored-procedures/sp-estimate-data-compression-savings-transact-sql).

Because SQL Server supports data compression on the partition level, you can combine SQL Server data compression with table partitioning to achieve flexible data archiving on historical parts of a large table, without having the CPU overhead on the active part of the table.

> [!NOTE]
> Prior to SQL Server 2016 SP1, compression wasn't available in every edition of SQL Server.

For more general information about table compression in SQL Server, see [Data Compression](/sql/relational-databases/data-compression/data-compression). For guidance on strategy, capacity planning, and best practices for data compression, see [Data Compression: Strategy, Capacity Planning, and Best Practices](/previous-versions/sql/sql-server-2008/dd894051(v=sql.100)).

## Default SQL constraints on columns

To add a default constraint to a field (column), use the following SQL statement:

```sql
ALTER TABLE ADD CONSTRAINT constraint_name DEFAULT default_value FOR field_name
```

The name of the default constraint isn't important, as long as it isn't used by another column in the database.
