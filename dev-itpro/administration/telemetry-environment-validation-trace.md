# Analyzing environment validation telemetry

[!INCLUDE[component](../developer/includes/online_only.md)]

[!INCLUDE[azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id](~/../shared-content/shared/azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id.md)]

Non-compatible, partner apps (per-tenant extensions) can block upgrades to next major version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] if they can't compile on that version. The [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] service proactively validates all environments regularly against the next release. If an environment isn't ready to be updated, then the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] service sends an email to the administrator and, starting from September 2023, emits telemetry on these validations. 

With this telemetry, partners can monitor environments for the customers and setup alerts so that they know up front which customers need help prior to updating to the next major version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)].

Failed operations result in a tracelog entry that includes a reason for the failure.

The validation flow is as follows:

```text
First, environment validation started (LC0220). 
For each extension (main + dependent extensions)
        Extension validation started (LC0204)
        Either 
                Extension validation completed successfully (LC0225)
        or
                Extension Validation diagnostic reported (LC0210)
                Extension validation completed with failures (LC0226)
Finally, 
either 
        Environment validation completed successfully (LC0222)
or
        Environment validation completed with failures (LC0223)
        Environment diagnostic reported (LC0227)
```

## <a name="environment-validation-started"></a>Environment validation started (LC0220)

Occurs when a new validation attempt is started for the environment.
