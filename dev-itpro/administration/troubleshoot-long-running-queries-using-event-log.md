# Troubleshooting: Using the Event Viewer to Monitor Long Running SQL Queries in Business Central

This article shows how you can monitor long running SQL queries in Event Viewer. You use the information determine SQL queries that are good candidates for optimization. 

## Resolution

Identifying long running SQL queries can be a good starting point when doing a performance analysis. Open the Event Viewer and go to the Windows Logs Application.

> [!NOTE]  
> The SQL queries which exceed the set threshold will be displayed in the Application window of the Event Viewer as *Warning*. 

If the value of the [SqlLongRunningThreshold](configure-server-instance.md) key was set to the default value of 1000 milliseconds, you'll see the message: "*Action completed successfully, but it took longer than the given threshold.*" for actions that took longer.

To meet performance expectations in production, you can set the threshold to a different value. You can set the threshold without restarting the server instance. For more information on how to set the threshold, see [Monitoring Long Running SQL Queries using the Event Log](monitor-long-running-sql-queries-event-log.md).

### Using the AL call stack

Long running queries that involve the explicit execution of AL code will include an AL call stack in the event log. Long running queries that aren't the result of explicit AL code won't include an AL call stack. For example:

- GetPage calls that load data into the UI.
- Calls to triggers that don't include any code. These calls won't include an AL call stack, because there no AL code is run.

Looking at the AL call stack can help you identify what caused the delay. For queries that include an AL call stack, the generated SQL statement is listed in the `AL CallStack` column. The following code example shows which AL method generated a slow running query.
