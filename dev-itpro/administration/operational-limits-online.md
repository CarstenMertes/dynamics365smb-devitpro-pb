# Operational limits for Business Central online

To ensure the availability and quality of Business Central services, there are limits on certain operations. This article describes the limits and, in some cases, the strategy behind them.

> [!TIP]
> Telemetry is gathered on some of the operations that have a limit. The telemetry provides insight into operations for which limits were exceeded. For more information, see [Monitoring and Analyzing Telemetry](telemetry-overview.md).

<!--
For [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] online, you can't change these limits, but it's useful to be aware of them. For on-premises installation, you can adjust most of the limits by configuring the [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)].

<!--
|Max data rows allowed to send to Excel|The maximum number of rows that can be included in an Excel document generated from a list type page <br /><br /> **Note:** This setting only pertains to list type pages in the client.

## <a name="ODataServicesUser"></a>OData request limits (per user)
  
|Setting|[!INCLUDE[bp_tabledescription](../developer/includes/bp_tabledescription_md.md)]|Limit|  
|-------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----|
|Max concurrent requests|The maximum number of OData V4 requests that can be processed at the same time. Requests that come in when this limit is exceeded will wait in a queue until a time slot becomes available. They wait in the queue until they time out after 8 minutes, where an HTTP response code `503 - Service Temporarily Unavailable` is returned. The more users you have in your environment, the more requests you can simultaneously process in it, as long as we can continuously scale our resources. If many requests are being processed at the same time and we couldn't sufficiently scale our resources, you might experience delays/throttling in processing your requests.|5, see [frequently asked questions on per-user limits](#FAQsUser).|

The more users you have in your environment, the more requests you can submit to it around the same time, as long as we can continuously scale our resources. If many requests are being submitted around the same time and we couldn't sufficiently scale our resources, you might experience throttling in submitting your requests.|6000, see [frequently asked questions on per-user limits](#FAQsUser).| 

## <a name="SOAPServicesUser"></a>SOAP request limits (per user)

|Setting|[!INCLUDE[bp_tabledescription](../developer/includes/bp_tabledescription_md.md)]|Limit|  
|-------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----|
|Rate|The maximum number of SOAP requests that can be submitted within a 5-minute sliding window. When this limit is exceeded, an HTTP response code `429 - Too Many Requests` is returned. The more users you have in your environment, the more requests you can submit to the environment around the same time, as long as we can continuously scale our resources. If many requests are being submitted around the same time and we can't sufficiently scale our resources, you might experience throttling in submitting your requests.|6000, see [frequently asked questions on per-user limits](#FAQsUser).|

> [!TIP]  
> Throttling could occur when many requests are submitted and handled (processed/queued) around the same time and they're taking a long time to complete. To optimize throughput, use API or OData instead of SOAP, as they execute faster.  We'll also reduce the throughput for SOAP and [deprecate it](../upgrade/deprecated-features-platform.md#soap-endpoints-warning) in the future.

## <a name="FAQsUser"></a>Frequently asked questions on per-user limits

This section includes frequently asked questions on per-user limits. If you have questions that aren't answered, please submit them using the **This page** option in the **Feedback** section below.

### How do these limits apply to how many tasks, requests, or other resource consumption units a user is entitled to each day?

These operational limits control "how fast" you can consume resources simultaneously or in short periods (per second/minute) and are not related to entitlement quotas that control "how much" you can consume resources in longer periods (per day/week/month). At present, we haven't set definite entitlement quotas, but will do so in the future.

### Are limits applied differently for application users?

No. These operational limits are applied to all users in the same way.

### Do more users mean more throughput per environment?

Yes, you can increase throughput by distributing your workload across multiple users. The more users you have in your environment, the more resources you can simultaneously consume in it, as long as we can continuously scale our resources. If a lot of resources are consumed at the same time and we couldn't sufficiently scale our resources, you might experience delays/throttling in consuming your resources.
