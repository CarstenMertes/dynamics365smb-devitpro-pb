# Analyzing Database Deadlock Telemetry

**INTRODUCED IN:** Business Central 2022 release wave 1, version 20.0

[!INCLUDE[azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id](~/../shared-content/shared/azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id.md)]

The database deadlock telemetry gathers information about deadlocks that happen. Deadlocks can prevent users from completing tasks in the Business Central client. A deadlock occurs when two or more processes block each other because each has locked a database resource. The system terminates and rolls back one of the sessions (known as the deadlock victim), then emits a telemetry signal.

As a partner or developer, this telemetry provides several benefits:

- Makes you aware that there are deadlocks happening.
- Let's you identify who was the victim in deadlock situations.
- In some deadlock problems, the process that is the victim and the process that succeeds will change by chance. In these cases, both will be stored in the telemetry resource as different deadlock events.
- For further monitoring and troubleshooting, this telemetry is complimented by other features like:
  - Enable SQL database deadlock monitoring on a sandbox or on-premises environment. For more information, see [Monitoring SQL Database Deadlocks](monitor-database-deadlocks.md).
  - Database lock trace telemetry. For more information, see [Database lock trace telemetry](telemetry-database-locks-trace.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For Business Central on-premises, you must turn on the EnableDeadlockMonitoring setting of the [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] instance to collect the telemetry. For more information, see [Configuring Business Central Server](configure-server-instance.md#Database).
