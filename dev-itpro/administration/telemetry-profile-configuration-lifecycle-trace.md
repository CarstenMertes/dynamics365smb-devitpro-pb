# Analyzing profile configuration lifecycle telemetry

**APPLIES TO:** [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] 2022 release wave 2, version 21.0, and later

[!INCLUDE[azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id](~/../shared-content/shared/azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id.md)]

From the [!INCLUDE[web](../developer/includes/webclient.md)], users can do various operations on profiles, like, import/export, create, copy, and remove. To learn more about these operations, see [Manage User Profiles](/dynamics365/business-central/admin-users-profiles-roles) and [Customize Pages for Profiles](/dynamics365/business-central/ui-personalization-manage).

Business Central emits telemetry signals for these operations, which you can collect using an Application Insights resource. As a partner or consultant, this information gives you insight into what the service does with the profiles and page customizations you provide.

## <a name="other"></a>**Common custom dimensions**

The following table explains custom dimensions that are common to all profile configuration traces. 

|Dimension|Description or value|

|aadTenantId|Specifies the Microsoft Entra tenant ID used for Microsoft Entra authentication. For on-premises, if you aren't using Microsoft Entra authentication, this value is **common**. |
|companyName|The name of the company where the operation is applied. Added in version 20.0. |
|component|**Dynamics 365 Business Central Server**.|
|componentVersion|Specifies the version number of the component that emits telemetry (see the component dimension.)|
|environmentType|Specifies the environment type for the tenant, such as **Production**, **Sandbox**, **Trial**. See [Environment Types](tenant-admin-center-environments.md#types-of-environments).|
|telemetrySchemaVersion|Specifies the version of the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] telemetry schema.|
