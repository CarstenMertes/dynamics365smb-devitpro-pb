## Job queue telemetry events

[!INCLUDE[job_queue_telemetry_events](../includes/include-telemetry-job-queue-events.md)]


## <a name="other"></a>Common custom dimensions to all job queue events

The following table explains custom dimensions that are common to all job queue entry telemetry events described below.  

|Dimension|Description or value|
|---------|-----| 
|alCategory|**AL JobQueueEntries**|
|aadTenantId|[!INCLUDE[aadTenantId](../includes/include-telemetry-dimension-aadtenantid.md)]|
|environmentName|[!INCLUDE[environmentName](../includes/include-telemetry-dimension-environment-name.md)]|
|environmentType|[!INCLUDE[environmentType](../includes/include-telemetry-dimension-environment-type.md)]|
|companyName| [!INCLUDE[companyName](../includes/include-telemetry-dimension-company-name.md)] |
|alJobQueueScheduledTaskId|Specifies the ID of the scheduled task.|
|alJobQueueEarliestStartDateTime|Specifies the earliest start date/time for the job queue entry.|
|alJobQueueId|Specifies the ID of the job queue entry.|
|alJobQueueIsRecurring|Specifies if the job queue is recurring. **True** indicates it's recurring. **False** indicates it's not recurring. Note that the values in the dimension is localized to the language of the user session. |
|alJobQueueObjectId|Specifies the ID of the object that the job queue entry runs.|
|alJobQueueObjectName|Specifies the name of the object that the job queue entry runs. </br></br>This dimension was introduced in version 22.0.|
|alJobQueueObjectType|Specifies the type of the object that the job queue entry runs, for example **Report** or **Codeunit**.|
|alJobQueueObjectDescription|Specifies the description of the object that the job queue entry runs. </br></br>This dimension was introduced in version 22.2.|
|alJobQueueStackTrace|Specifies the AL stack trace of the job queue entry. </br></br>This dimension was introduced in version 21.3. |
|alJobQueueStatus|**Ready** indicates it's a non-recurring job queue entry or the first run of a recurring job queue entry that's ready to run. **In Process** indicates it's being run. **Error** indicates it encountered an error while running. **On Hold** indicates it's being queued. **Finished** indicates it's finished without error. **On Hold with Inactivity Timeout** indicates it's a recurring job query entry that's ready to run.|

## <a name="enqueued"></a>Job queue entry enqueued

Occurs when a job queue entry is sent to the job queue to eventually be run. A job queue entry is sent to the queue when its status is changed from **On Hold** to **Ready** or if it's a recurring job queue entry. Recurring job queue entries are automatically enqueued after each run.

```kql
// Job queue entry run failed
traces
| where timestamp > ago(60d) // adjust as needed
| where customDimensions.eventId == 'AL0000HE7'
| project timestamp
, aadTenantId = customDimensions.aadTenantId
, environmentName = customDimensions.environmentName
, environmentType = customDimensions.environmentType
, companyName = customDimensions.companyName
// jobQueueApp* dimensions contains the information about the app where the jobQueueObject* is located
, jobQueueAppId = customDimensions.alCallerAppId
, jobQueueAppName = customDimensions.alCallerAppName
, jobQueueAppPublisher = customDimensions.alCallerPublisher
, jobQueueAppVersion = customDimensions.alCallerAppVersion
// jobQueueObject* dimensions contains the information about the object containing the code being run
, jobQueueObjectId = customDimensions.alJobQueueObjectId 	
, jobQueueObjectName = customDimensions.alJobQueueObjectName // added in 22.0 
, jobQueueObjectType = customDimensions.alJobQueueObjectType
// jobQueueExecution dimensions contain information about the job queue entry definition

```


## <a name="errorStopped"></a>Job queue entry {Job Queue Id} errored after {attempt number} attempts
Occurs when a job queue entry fails to run. This telemetry event was introduced in version 21.5.

### General dimensions

|Dimension|Description or value|
|---------|-----|
|message|**Job queue entry {Job Queue Id} errored after {attempt number} attempts**|
|severityLevel|**2**|
|user_Id|[!INCLUDE[user_Id](../includes/include-telemetry-user-id.md)] |

### Custom dimensions

|Dimension|Description or value|
|---------|-----|
|eventId|**AL0000JRG**|
|[See common custom dimensions](#other)||

### Sample KQL code 

This KQL code can help you get started troubleshooting job queue errors where the entry has been vstopped because it failed  for the last time before being set in `Error` state. As an administrator, you want to know about job queue entries that are going into the final failed state and require manual intervention (restarting etc).

```kql
// Job queue entry {Job Queue Id} errored after {attempt number} attempts
traces
| where timestamp > ago(60d) // adjust as needed
| where customDimensions.eventId == 'AL0000JRG'
| project timestamp
, aadTenantId = customDimensions.aadTenantId
, environmentName = customDimensions.environmentName
, environmentType = customDimensions.environmentType
, companyName = customDimensions.companyName
// jobQueueApp* dimensions contains the information about the app where the jobQueueObject* is located
, jobQueueAppId = customDimensions.alCallerAppId
, jobQueueAppName = customDimensions.alCallerAppName
, jobQueueAppPublisher = customDimensions.alCallerPublisher
, jobQueueAppVersion = customDimensions.alCallerAppVersion
// jobQueueObject* dimensions contains the information about the object containing the code being run
, jobQueueObjectId = customDimensions.alJobQueueObjectId 	
, jobQueueObjectName = customDimensions.alJobQueueObjectName // added in 22.0

, jobQueueEntryMaxNumberOfAttemptsToRun = customDimensions.alJobQueueMaxNumberOfAttemptsToRun // added in 21.5
// jobQueueExecution dimensions contain information about the attempted run of the job queue entry
, jobQueueExecutionNumberOfAttemptsToRun = customDimensions.alJobQueueNumberOfAttemptsToRun // added in 21.5
, jobQueueExecutionStatus = customDimensions.alJobQueueStatus

## Job queues and performance

[!INCLUDE[task_job_queue_performance](../includes/include-task-job-queue-performance.md)]

## Troubleshooting Job queue issues with telemetry

The reason for a failed job queue entry could be in the code that is running. You can find the owner (also called publisher) of the code in the AL stack trace dimension in the job queue error event AL0000HE7. If the error comes from an app/extension, you need to contact the owner of the code to get it resolved. If the error comes from the Microsoft application, then you need to open a support request with Microsoft to get it resolved. 

See [event AL0000HE7](#error) above for sample KQL code to analyze further.


If a job queue entry fails after the maximum number of retry attempts has been done, the telemetry event AL0000JRG is emitted and the job queue entry is set to permanently being stopped. As an administrator, you want to know about these job queue entries that are going into the final failed state and require manual intervention (restarting etc).

See [event AL0000JRG](#errorStopped) above for sample KQL code to analyze further.


## Alerting on Job queue issues with telemetry

[!INCLUDE[alerts](../includes/include-telemetry-alerting.md)]

There exists at least three job queue error scenarios where you might want to setup alerts:

1. Some job queue entries fail
2. Some job queue entries failed and have been stopped
3. No job queue entries are running

In the table below, you can read more about the scenarios and get sample KQL code for the alerting conditions in your alerts.

| Condition | Area | Relevant for | Description | Event Id(s) | KQL sample code (*CTRL+click* to open in new page) |
| --------- | -----| ------------ | ----------- | --------------- | ------------ |
| Job queue errors | Errors | VAR | Get alerted on job queue entries fail. | AL0000E26 | [JobQueueFailures.kql](https://github.com/microsoft/BCTech/blob/master/samples/AppInsights/Alerts/AlertingKQLSamples/JobQueueFailures.kql) |
| Job queue stopped due to errors errors | Errors | VAR | Get alerted on job queue entries that are stopped due to recurring errors (because they have failed for all retry attempts). | AL0000JRG | [JobQueueFailures.kql](https://github.com/microsoft/BCTech/blob/master/samples/AppInsights/Alerts/AlertingKQLSamples/JobQueueFailures.kql) |
| Job queue not running | Errors | VAR | Get alerted if no job queue entries have been started in a given time period. | AL0000E26 | [NoJobQueueRuns.kql](https://github.com/microsoft/BCTech/blob/master/samples/AppInsights/Alerts/AlertingKQLSamples/NoJobQueueRuns.kql) |
