# Analyzing cloud migration trace telemetry

**INTRODUCED IN:** Business Central 2023 release wave 1, version 22.1

Cloud migration telemetry gathers data about the success or failure of the following operations:

- Replication runs
- Cloud migration setup
- Data upgrade 

Failed operations result in a trace log entry that includes a reason for the failure.

## Replication run started

Occurs when a replication run starts.
