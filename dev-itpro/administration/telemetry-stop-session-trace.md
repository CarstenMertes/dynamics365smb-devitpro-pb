# Analyzing Stopped Session Telemetry

[!INCLUDE[azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id](~/../shared-content/shared/azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id.md)]

In Business Central, a background session is session without a UI that runs a specified codeunit. Background sessions are started and stopped by calling the [StartSession](..\developer\methods-auto\session\session-startsession-integer-integer-string-table-method.md) and [StopSession](..\developer\methods-auto\session\session-stopsession-method.md) methods from AL. With Business Central online, sessions can be stopped by using the admin center, which indirectly calls the StopSession method. For more information, see [Managing Sessions](tenant-admin-center-manage-sessions.md).

With Application Insights, you can record when sessions are stopped, either by direct calls to the StopSession method or from the admin center.

## <a name="stopsession"></a>The StopSession method was invoked on session

A session was stopped by a direct call to the StopSession method from AL or from the admin center.
