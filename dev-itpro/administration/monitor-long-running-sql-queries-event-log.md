# Monitoring and Analyzing Long Running SQL Queries

<!-- This topic needs to be updated for the BC autumn release. -->
 
[!INCLUDE[nav2017](../developer/includes/nav2017.md)] was the first version that allows long running SQL queries to be logged to the Windows Event Log. The queries are logged when the application communicates with the database and the call to the database takes too long. Starting in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] 2019 release wave 2, long running queries can also be emitted as telemetry to Microsoft Azure Application Insights. Using Application Insights requires that you first enable it on your tenant.

## <a name="threshold"></a>Defining the long running SQL queries threshold

The time logged when a SQL query runs is the time spent on the called database as seen from the server. There are multiple reasons that can cause a delay. For example, a delay happens when the database waits for a lock to release. Or it runs an operation that's missing indexes.

The threshold of when a SQL query is considered to be long running is controlled by the [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] configuration setting **SqlLongRunningThreshold**. The default value is 1000 milliseconds (ms). By default, the threshold is set to 1000 milliseconds. In this case, if a SQL query runs longer 1000 ms, a message is recorded in the event log and emitted as telemetry. The message indicates that the action took longer than expected or longer than the given threshold. For more information about setting the **SqlLongRunningThreshold** by using [!INCLUDE[admintool](../developer/includes/admintool.md)], see [Configuring Business Central Server](configure-server-instance.md#Database).

You can also change the setting by [Set-NAVServerConfiguration cmdlet](/powershell/module/microsoft.dynamics.nav.management/set-navserverconfiguration) in [!INCLUDE[adminshell](../developer/includes/adminshell.md)]. The cmdlet includes the `-ApplyTo Memory`parameter that enables you to change the setting without doing a server restart. For example, to change the threshold dynamically to 2000 ms, run the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] Administration Shell as Administrator and then type the following PowerShell cmdlet:

```
Set-NAVServerConfiguration -ServerInstance <ServerInstanceName> -KeyName SqlLongRunningThreshold -KeyValue 2000 -ApplyTo Memory
```

## Monitor and analyze data

To use the Windows Event Log, see [Troubleshooting: Using the Event Viewer to Monitor Long Running SQL Queries](troubleshoot-long-running-queries-using-event-log.md).

To set up and use Application Insights, see [Enabling Application Insights for Tenant Telemetry](telemetry-enable-application-insights.md).
<!-- 
## <a name="ApplicationInsights"></a>Enable Sending Telemetry to Application Insights

If you have access to an Application Insights resource in Microsoft Azure, you can configure your tenants to send long running query telemetry there for analysis and presentation.

1. To enable this feature, you will first need the instrumentation key of the Application Insights resource, which you can get from the [Azure Portal](/azure/bot-service/bot-service-resources-app-insights-keys?view=azure-bot-service-4.0).

2. Once you have the key, the way to enable this feature depends on whether your [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] instance is configured as a single-tenant or multitenant instance. 

    - For a single-tenant server instance, you enable this feature on the server instance itself by adding the key to the **Application Insights Instrumentation Key** setting of the server instance. For more information, see [Configuring Business Central Server](configure-server-instance.md#General).
    
    - For a multitenant server instance, you enable this feature on a per-tenant basis when you mount tenants on the [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] instance. The [Mount-NAVTenant cmdlet](/powershell/module/microsoft.dynamics.nav.management/mount-navtenant?view=businesscentral-ps) includes the `-ApplicationInsightsKey` parameter that you set to the instrumentation key, for example:
    
        ```
        Mount-NAVTenant -ServerInstance BC150 -Tenant tenant1 -DatabaseName "Demo Database BC (15-0)" -DatabaseServer localhost -DatabaseInstance BCDEMO -ApplicationInsightsKey 11111111-2222-3333-4444-555555555555
        ```

## Monitor and analyze data

If you are using the event log, refer to the following articles:

[Troubleshooting: Using the Event Log to Monitor Long Running SQL Queries](troubleshoot-long-running-queries-using-event-log.md)

[Troubleshooting: Analyzing Long Running SQL Queries Involving FlowFields by Disabling SmartSQL](troubleshooting-queries-involving-flowfields-by-disabling-smartsql.md)

If you are using application Insights, see:

[Analyzing Long Running Operation (SQL Query) Telemetry](telemetry-long-running-sql-query-trace.md).-->

<!--
### <a name="LRSQLQuery"></a>Dimensions for long running SQL queries emitted to Application Insights

The following tables explains the columns included in long running query events emitted to Application Insights. Bold text indicates that the value of the columns is a constant. Some columns are standard for Application Insights. These are indicated by *Application Insights*.

|Column|Description or value||
|---------|-----|-----------|
|timestamp|Specifies the date and time that the long running query event occurred, such as 2019-08-20T07:23:07.9996696Z||
|message|**Action took longer than expected**||
|severityLevel|**2** (This indicates a warning. Long running queries are always recorded as warnings)||
|itemType|**trace**||
|customDimensions|(see table that follows)||
|operation_Name|**Long Running Operation (SQL Query)**||
|operation_Id|Specifies the GUID assigned to the client operation. An operation is created whenever the user performs an activity in the client, such as selecting an action.||
|operation_ParentId|Currently this is the same as the operation_Id. This might change in a future release.||
|session_Id|Specifies the GUID of the client session. When a client establishes a connection to the [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] instance, a session is created and it is assigned an ID. ||
