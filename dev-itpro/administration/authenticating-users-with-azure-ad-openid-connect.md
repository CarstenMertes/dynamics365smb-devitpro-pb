# Configure Microsoft Entra authentication with OpenID Connect

[!INCLUDE[2022_releasewave1](../includes/2022_releasewave1.md)]

[!INCLUDE[azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id](~/../shared-content/shared/azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id.md)]

This article explains how to configure Business Central to use Microsoft Entra ID to authenticate users. This setup configures Microsoft Entra authentication to use [OpenID connect](). 

## Preparation

- Obtain and set up security certificates on the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] deployment

    Microsoft Entra authentication requires the use of service certificates to help secure client connections over a wide area network (WAN). In a production environment, you should obtain a certificate from a certification authority or trusted provider. In a test environment, if you don't have a certificate, then you can create your own self-signed certificate. The implementation of certificates involves installation and configuration of the certificates on the [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] server and client computers.

    Follow the instructions for obtaining and installing the certificates [Using Certificates to Secure Connections](../deployment/implement-security-certificates-production-environment.md). However, for now, **don't** change the credential type used by [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] and [!INCLUDE[webserver](../developer/includes/webserver.md)] yet. You'll change it later in this article.

## Task 1: Create a Microsoft Entra tenant

To get started, you need a Microsoft Entra tenant. The Microsoft Entra tenant is where you manage user accounts and register apps, like [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)].

There are a couple ways to get a Microsoft Entra tenant:

- Sign up a Microsoft 365 plan

    If you have a Microsoft 365 subscription that is based on a domain such as *solutions\.onmicrosoft\.com*, then you're already using Microsoft Entra ID. The Microsoft 365 user accounts are based on Microsoft Entra ID. So, there's nothing more to do in this task.

    If you want to sign up for a Microsoft 365 plan, you can use a plan such as Microsoft 365 Enterprise E1 as your test site, or sign up for a trial developer plan. A trial plan includes an administrative account that you'll use to access the Azure management portal. If your Microsoft 365 site is *solutions.onmicrosoft.com*, for example, your administrative account can be *admin\@solutions\.onmicrosoft\.com*. For more information, see [Select a Microsoft 365 plan for business](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=309050).

- Sign up for an Azure subscription that isn't associated with a Microsoft 365 subscription and create your own Microsoft Entra tenant. For more information, see the next section.

### Create your own Microsoft Entra tenants

If you have a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises deployment configured for multitenancy, you can choose to use the same Microsoft Entra tenant for all [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] tenants. Or you can create a separate Microsoft Entra tenant for each [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] tenant.

1. Sign up for an Azure subscription at [https://azure.microsoft.com](https://azure.microsoft.com).
2. Sign in to [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
3. Create a directory by following the instructions at [How to get a Microsoft Entra tenant](/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-howto-tenant).

    This step will create a Microsoft Entra tenant. When you create a Microsoft Entra ID in the Azure portal, you specify an initial domain name that identifies your Microsoft Entra tenant, such as *solutions.onmicrosoft.com* or *cronusinternationltd.onmicrosoft.com*. You'll use the domain name when you add users to your Microsoft Entra ID and when you configure the [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] instance. In the tasks that follow, this value is referred to as the Microsoft Entra tenant ID. 

4. After you've created the Microsoft Entra tenant, add users.

    For more information, see [Quickstart: Add new users to Microsoft Entra ID](/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/add-users-azure-active-directory). Later, you'll have to map the users in Microsoft Entra ID to your users in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)].

## Task 2: Register an application in the Microsoft Entra tenant  

In this task, you register your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] solution as an application in the Microsoft Entra tenant.

> [!NOTE]
> If you're configuring a multitenant deployment, where each tenant will use a different Azure Tenant, you only register an application on one of the Microsoft Entra tenants. Then, you'll make the application available to the other Microsoft Entra tenants by making it a *Multitenant* application.

1. Sign in to [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and open the Microsoft Entra tenant.

2. To register the application, follow the guidelines at [Registering Business Central On-Premises in Microsoft Entra ID for Integrating with Other Services](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/register-app-azure).

    When you add an application to a Microsoft Entra tenant, you specify the following information. The configuration is slightly different in for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] single-tenant and multitenant deployment.

    # [Single-tenant](#tab/singletenant)

    | Setting | Description |
    |--|--|
    |Name|Specifies the name of your application as it will display to your users, such as **Business Central App by My Solutions**.|
    |Supported account types|Select Accounts in any organizational directory (Any Microsoft Entra ID directory - Multitenant)|
    |Redirect URI|Specifies the type of application that you're registering and the redirect URI (or reply URL) for your application. Set the type to **Web**, and in the redirect URL box, enter URL for signing in to the [!INCLUDE[webclient](../developer/includes/webclient.md)], for example `https://localhost:443/BC220/SignIn`.<br /><br />The URI has the format `https://<domain or computer name>/<webserver-instance>/SignIn`, such as `https://cronusinternationltd.onmicrosoft.com/BC220/SignIn` or `https://MyBcWebServer/BC220/SignIn`. <br /> <br />**Important** The portion of the reply URL after the domain name (in this case `BC220/SignIn`) is case-sensitive, so make sure that the web server instance name matches the case of the web server instance name as it is defined on IIS for your [!INCLUDE[webserver](../developer/includes/webserver.md)] installation.|

    # [Multitenant-tenant](#tab/multitenant)
    
    | Setting | Description |
    |--|--|
    |Name|Specifies the name of your application as it will display to your users, such as **Business Central App by My Solutions**.|
    |Supported account types|Specifies the accounts that you would like your application to support. If you're going to use different Microsoft Entra tenants for different [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] tenants, then select **Accounts in any organizational directory (Any Microsoft Entra ID directory - Multitenant)**. Otherwise, you can choose **Accounts in this organizational directory only (Single tenant)**.|
    |Redirect URI|Specifies the type of application that you're registering and the redirect URI (or reply URL) for your application. Set the type to **Web**, and in the redirect URL box, enter URL for signing in to the [!INCLUDE[webclient](../developer/includes/webclient.md)], for example `https://localhost:443/BC220/SignIn`.<br /><br />The URI has the format `https://<domain or computer name>/<webserver-instance>/SignIn`, such as `https://cronusinternationltd.onmicrosoft.com/BC220/SignIn` or `https://MyBcWebServer/BC220/SignIn`.<br /> <br />**Important** The portion of the reply URL after the domain name (in this case `BC220/SignIn`) is case-sensitive, so make sure that the web server instance name matches the case of the web server instance name as it is defined on IIS for your [!INCLUDE[webserver](../developer/includes/webserver.md)] installation.|

    ---

3. Set up ID tokens for implicit grant and hybrid flows:

   1. Select **Authentication**.
   2. Under **Implicit grant and hybrid flows**, select **ID tokens (used for implicit and hybrid flows)**.
   3. Select **Save**.

4. The [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] solution is now registered in your Microsoft Entra tenant. To complete the steps that follow, you'll need the following information:

   - Tenant's domain (**Directory (tenant) ID**)
   - **Redirect URI**
   - **Application (client) ID**

    You can view the settings in the Azure portal by selecting **Overview** for the registered application. So, make a note of or copy the values for these settings for later use.

> [!NOTE]
> The guidelines for the Azure Portal in this article might not reflect the current user interface of the Azure Portal. Please refer to the Azure Portal documentation for the latest instructions.

## <a name="task3"></a>Task 3: Associate Microsoft Entra ID Users with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] Users
  
Each user in your Microsoft Entra tenant that will access [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] must be set up with an account in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)].

You can postpone this task for most users and do it after you complete Microsoft Entra ID setup. But you must do this task now for your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] user account. If you don't, you won't be able to sign in to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] after you switch to Microsoft Entra ID.

To associate a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] user with Microsoft Entra ID, set the user's authentication email in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] to the user's principal name in Microsoft Entra ID, like *chris@contoso.com*. <!-- When you combine this setting with the relevant configuration of the [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] instance, users achieve single sign-on when they access [!INCLUDE[nav_web](../developer/includes/nav_web_md.md)].-->

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), get the Microsoft Entra ID user's principal name.

    For more information, see [Users in Microsoft Entra ID](/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/add-users-azure-active-directory) in the Azure help.

2. Assign the Azure user principal name to the Business Central user. You can use the web client or [!INCLUDE[adminshell](../developer/includes/adminshell.md)].

  # [Business Central Web client](#tab/admintool)

  1. Start the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] and open the **Users** page.
  2. Open the user that you want to modify.
  3. Under **Microsoft 365 (Authentication)**, set the **Authentication Email** to the user principal name  in Microsoft Entra ID.

  # [Administration Shell](#tab/adminshell)

  1. Run [!INCLUDE[adminshell](../developer/includes/adminshell.md)] as an administrator.
  2. Run the [Set-NAVServerUser cmdlet](/powershell/module/microsoft.dynamics.nav.management/set-navserveruser) to set the authentication email. For example:

     ```powershell
     Set-NAVServerUser -WindowsAccount yourdomain\username -AuthenticationEmail "AzureAD_principal_name"
     ```
---

For more information, see [Create Users According to Licenses](/dynamics365/business-central/ui-how-users-permissions).

## Task 4: Configure [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)]

Once you have the Microsoft Entra tenant and a registered application for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)], you configure the [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] instance for Microsoft Entra authentication.

1. Run [!INCLUDE[adminshell](../developer/includes/adminshell.md)] as an administrator.
 
    To configure the server instance in the next steps, you'll use the [Set-NAVServerConfiguration cmdlet](/powershell/module/microsoft.dynamics.nav.management/set-navserverconfiguration).

2. Set the `ClientServicesCredentialType` to `AccessControlService`.

   ```powershell
   Set-NAVServerConfiguration -ServerInstance $BCServerInstanceName  -KeyName ClientServicesCredentialType -KeyValue AccessControlService
   ```

3. Configure the Microsoft Entra ID settings.

    This step is different for a single-tenant and multitenant [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] deployments.

    1. Set the `ValidAudiences` parameter to the **Application (client) ID** of the registered application in Microsoft Entra ID. If you'll be using [service-to-service (S2S) authentication](automation-apis-using-s2s-authentication.md) for Business Central APIs, include `https://api.businesscentral.dynamics.com` in the value.

        The value has the following format:

        ```powershell
        Set-NAVServerConfiguration -ServerInstance $BCServerInstanceName  -KeyName ValidAudiences -KeyValue "<application ID>;https://api.businesscentral.dynamics.com"
        ```

        **Example**

        ```powershell
        Set-NAVServerConfiguration -ServerInstance BC230 -KeyName ValidAudiences -KeyValue "44444444-cccc-5555-dddd-666666666666;https://api.businesscentral.dynamics.com"
        ```

    2. Set the `ADOpenIdMetadataLocation` parameter for version 22 and later or `ClientServicesFederationMetadataLocation` parameter for version 21 and earlier.

        The value has the following format:

        ```powershell
        Set-NAVServerConfiguration -ServerInstance $BCServerInstanceName  -KeyName ADOpenIdMetadataLocation -KeyValue "https://login.microsoftonline.com/{AADTENANTID}/.well-known/openid-configuration"
        ```

        or

        ```powershell
        Set-NAVServerConfiguration -ServerInstance $BCServerInstanceName  -KeyName ClientServicesFederationMetadataLocation -KeyValue "https://login.microsoftonline.com/<AAD TENANT ID>/FederationMetadata/2007-06/FederationMetadata.xml"
        ```

        # [Single-tenant](#tab/singletenant)

        Replace `<AAD TENANT ID>` with the ID of the Microsoft Entra tenant ID or its domain, for example, `11111111-aaaa-2222-bbbb-333333333333` or `CRONUSInternationLtd.onmicrosoft.com`.

        For example:

        ```powershell
        Set-NAVServerConfiguration -ServerInstance BC230 -KeyName ADOpenIdMetadataLocation -KeyValue "https://login.microsoftonline.com/cronusinternationltd.onmicrosoft.com/.well-known/openid-configuration"
        ```  

        or

        ```powershell
        Set-NAVServerConfiguration -ServerInstance BC210 -KeyName ClientServicesFederationMetadataLocation -KeyValue "https://login.microsoftonline.com/cronusinternationltd.onmicrosoft.com/FederationMetadata/2007-06/FederationMetadata.xml"
        ```  

        # [Multitenant-tenant](#tab/multitenant)

        Replace `<AAD TENANT ID>` with `common`.

        <!--
        |Value|Description|
        |-|-|
        |`{AADTENANTID}`|Use this value if each [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] tenant corresponds to a Microsoft Entra tenant that has a service principal. The [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] instance will automatically replace `{AADTENANTID}` with the correct Microsoft Entra tenant. The Microsoft Entra tenant ID is specified when you mount the tenant. ID parameter that is specified when mounting a tenant replaces the placeholder.
        |`common`|Use this value if the corresponding [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] application in Microsoft Entra ID configured as a multitenant application, but tenants will use the same Microsoft Entra tenant|
        -->

        For example:

        ```powershell
        Set-NAVServerConfiguration -ServerInstance BC230 -KeyName ADOpenIdMetadataLocation -KeyValue "https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/.well-known/openid-configuration"
        ```

        or

        ```powershell
        Set-NAVServerConfiguration -ServerInstance BC210 -KeyName ClientServicesFederationMetadataLocation -KeyValue "https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/FederationMetadata/2007-06/FederationMetadata.xml"
        ```

        ---

       > [!IMPORTANT]
       > The `AzureActiveDirectoryClientSecret`, `AzureActiveDirectoryClientId`, and `AzureActiveDirectoryClientSecret` parameters aren't used. The `AzureActiveDirectoryClientId` must be empty or set to `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000`. If not, you'll get the following error when you try to sign in to Business Central: `The value for the WSFederationLoginEndpoint configuration settings cannot be empty`.

    3. If you'll be setting up the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] add-in for Excel, set the `WSFederationLoginEndpoint` parameter.

        The WS-federation login endpoint is the URL of the sign-on page that [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] redirects to when users sign in from a client. Specify a URL in the following format:

        ```
        https://login.microsoftonline.com/<AAD TENANT ID>/wsfed?wa=wsignin1.0%26wtrealm=<Application ID URI>%26wreply=<Redirect URL>
        ```

        |Parameter|Description|
        |-|-|-|
        |`<AAD TENANT ID>`|The ID of the Microsoft Entra tenant ID or its domain, like `11111111-aaaa-2222-bbbb-333333333333` or `CRONUSInternationLtd.onmicrosoft.com`.|
        |`<Application ID URI>`|The ID that was assigned to the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] application when it was registered in Microsoft Entra ID, for example `api://44444444-cccc-5555-dddd-666666666666` or `https://cronusinternationltd.onmicrosoft.com/businesscentral`.|
        |`<Redirect URL>`|The redirect URL that was assigned to the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] application when it was registered in the Microsoft Entra tenant. This parameter must point to the SignIn page of the [!INCLUDE[nav_web](../developer/includes/nav_web_md.md)]. Make sure it exactly matches the **Redirect URL** that was configured on the application in Microsoft Entra ID.|

       > [!IMPORTANT]
       > The string parameter must be URI-encoded. This means, for example, use "%26" instead of "&".

        **Example**

        ```powershell
        Set-NAVServerConfiguration -ServerInstance BC210 -KeyName WSFederationLoginEndpoint -KeyValue "https://login.microsoftonline.com/cronusinternationltd.onmicrosoft.com/wsfed?wa=wsignin1.0%26wtrealm=https://cronusinternationltd.onmicrosoft.com/businesscentral%26wreply=https://cronusinternationltd.onmicrosoft.com/BC210/SignIn"
        ```

4. To configure SOAP and OData web services for Microsoft Entra authentication, specify the App ID URI that is registered for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] in the Microsoft Entra ID.

    ```powershell
    Set-NAVServerConfiguration -ServerInstance $BCServerInstanceName  -KeyName AppIdUri -KeyValue "<Application ID URI>"
    ```

    The value is typically the same as the *wtrealm* parameter value of the WSFederationLoginEndpoint parameter. 

    **Example**

    ```powershell
    Set-NAVServerConfiguration -ServerInstance BC210  -KeyName AppIdUri -KeyValue "https://cronusinternationltd.onmicrosoft.com"
    ```

5. Restart the server instance. For example:

    ```powershell
    Restart-NAVServerInstance -ServerInstance BC210
    ```
<!--
---
-->

## Task 5: Configure [!INCLUDE[webservercomponents](../developer/includes/webservercomponents.md)]

1. Set the `ClientServicesCredentialType` key to `AccessControlService`.

    ```powershell
    Set-NAVWebServerInstanceConfiguration -WebServerInstance BC210 -KeyName ClientServicesCredentialType -KeyValue "AccessControlService"
    ```

2. Set the `AadApplicationId` key to the application (client) ID of the registered application for Business Central in Microsoft Entra ID.

    ```powershell
    Set-NAVWebServerInstanceConfiguration -WebServerInstance $BCServerInstanceName -KeyName AadApplicationId -KeyValue $AADApplicationId
    ```

    For example:

    ```powershell
    Set-NAVWebServerInstanceConfiguration -WebServerInstance $BCServerInstanceName -KeyName AadApplicationId "44444444-cccc-5555-dddd-666666666666"
    ```

3. Set the `AadAuthorityUri` key.

    ```powershell
    Set-NAVWebServerInstanceConfiguration -WebServerInstance $BCServerInstanceName -KeyName AadAuthorityUri -KeyValue "https://login.microsoftonline.com/<AzureADTenantID>"
    ```

    # [Single-tenant](#tab/singletenant)

    Replace `<AAD TENANT ID>` with the ID of the Microsoft Entra tenant ID or its domain, for example, `11111111-aaaa-2222-bbbb-333333333333` or `CRONUSInternationLtd.onmicrosoft.com`.

    For example:

    ```powershell
    Set-NAVWebServerInstanceConfiguration -WebServerInstance $BCServerInstanceName -KeyName AadAuthorityUri -KeyValue "https://login.microsoftonline.com/11111111-aaaa-2222-bbbb-333333333333"
    ```

    # [Multitenant-tenant](#tab/multitenant)

    Replace `<AAD TENANT ID>` with `common`.

    <!--

    |Value|Description|
    |-|-|
    |`{AADTENANTID}`|Use this value if each [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] tenant corresponds to a Microsoft Entra tenant that has a service principal. The [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] instance will automatically replace `{AADTENANTID}` with the correct Microsoft Entra tenant. The Microsoft Entra tenant ID is specified when you mount the tenant. ID parameter that is specified when mounting a tenant replaces the placeholder.
    |`common`|Use this value if the corresponding [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] application in Microsoft Entra ID configured as a multitenant application, but tenants will use the same Microsoft Entra tenant|

    -->
    For example:

    <!--
    ```powershell
    Set-NAVServerConfiguration -ServerInstance BC200 -KeyName ClientServicesFederationMetadataLocation -KeyValue "https://login.microsoftonline.com/{AADTENANTID}"
    ```
    -->
    or

    ```powershell
    Set-NAVServerConfiguration -ServerInstance BC210 -KeyName ClientServicesFederationMetadataLocation -KeyValue "https://login.microsoftonline.com/common"
    ```

For more information, see [Configure Configuring [!INCLUDE[webserver](../developer/includes/webserver.md)] Instances](configure-web-server.md) and [Configure Authentication](users-credential-types.md).

## Task 7: Mount tenants (multitenant only)

If you have a multitenant [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] environment, mount the tenant databases on the [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)].

Mount your tenants by using the [Mount-NAVTenant cmdlet](/powershell/module/microsoft.dynamics.nav.management/mount-navtenant).

- If you'll be using the same Microsoft Entra tenant for all [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] tenants, you can omit the `-AadTenantId` parameter.
- If you'll be using different Microsoft Entra tenants, set the `-AadTenantId` parameter to the ID or domain name of the Microsoft Entra tenant that you want to use for the tenant.
- Also, if you've set up different host names that you want to use accessing the tenant, use the `-AlternateId` parameter. See [Using alternate tenant IDs](#altid).

For example:

```powershell
Mount-NAVTenant -ServerInstance BC210  -Tenant Tenant1 –DatabaseServer ..\BCDEMO -DatabaseName "BC Demo Database" -AadTenantId 1111-aaaa-2222-bbbb-333333333333
```
<!--
--- 
-->

## Task 8: Set up other users and web service accounts
  
### User accounts

Set up remaining [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] user accounts, which you didn't cover in [Task 3](#task3), with Microsoft Entra authentication email accounts.

### Web service accounts

With Microsoft Entra authentication, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)]  supports two different methods for authenticating users trying to access data through OData and SOAP web services: web service access keys (or Basic authentication) and OAuth.

With Basic authentication, the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] user account must have web service access key. To sign in, instead of using their Microsoft Entra ID password, users provide the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] the web service access key. For information about setting up web service access keys, see [How to use an Access Key for SOAP and OData Web Service Authentication](../webservices/web-services-authentication.md#accesskey).

With OAuth, users are authenticated based on their Microsoft Entra ID credentials, providing a more direct and single sign-on experience. See [Using OAuth to Authorize Business Central Web Services (OData and SOAP)](../webservices/authenticate-web-services-using-oauth.md).

## More Security and configuration tips

### Set the access token lifetime

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> For security reasons, we recommend that you limit the lifetime of the access token to 10 minutes as described in this section.

Follow the steps outlined below.

1. Download the latest [Microsoft Entra ID PowerShell Module Public Preview release](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/AzureADPreview/2.0.1.11).
2. Run the following command to sign in to your Microsoft Entra admin account: `Connect-AzureAD -Confirm`
3. Sign in as the tenant admin. 
4. Run the `Get-AzureADPolicy` command. 
5. For each `Id` that is the result of above command, run `Remove-AzureADPolicy -Id {Guid}`. 
6. Set the token lifetime to 10 minutes by running the following command: `New-AzureADPolicy -Definition @('{"TokenLifetimePolicy":{"Version":1, "AccessTokenLifetime":"0.00:10:00"}}') -DisplayName "OrganizationDefaultPolicyScenario" -IsOrganizationDefault $true -Type "TokenLifetimePolicy"`.

For reference, see the prerequisites section in the following article: [Configurable token lifetimes in Microsoft Entra ID](/azure/active-directory/active-directory-configurable-token-lifetimes#prerequisites).

### Increase the `ExtendedSecurityTokenLifetime` parameter value on Business Central Server

This parameter defines the interval of time that a client session can remain inactive before the session is dropped. If the value is too low, users may experience the error: **Connection is not longer available or was lost**. The event log will include the error: **The SAML2 token is not valid because its validity period has ended.** for the server instance. Increasing this value will resolve this issue. We recommend that you set it to a value greater than 8 hours.

```powershell
Set-NAVServerConfiguration -ServerInstance $BCServerInstanceName  -KeyName ExtendedSecurityTokenLifetime -KeyValue "<hours>"
```

**Example**

```powershell
Set-NAVServerConfiguration -ServerInstance BC210  -KeyName ExtendedSecurityTokenLifetime -KeyValue "20"
```

### Using host names for tenants

You can configure host name tenant resolution, where each tenant is assigned a unique domain, like customer1.cronusinternational.com. Customers would then access their tenant by using `https://customer1.cronusinternational.com/BC230`.

This setup implies that the public URL is different for each tenant. To support this scenario, you set [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] to calculate the host dynamically. In the `WSFederationLoginEndpoint` parameter, use the `{HOSTNAME}` placeholder in the `wreply`, for example:

```http
https://login.microsoftonline.com/<AAD TENANT ID>/wsfed?wa=wsignin1.0%26wtrealm=<APP ID URI>%26wreply=https://{HOSTNAME}/BC230/SignIn

```

### <a name="altid"></a>Using alternate tenant IDs

When you mount a tenant, you can give the tenant an additional ID by setting the `-AlternateId` parameter. Users can then access the tenant using this ID as well as the original. The alternate ID is useful if you have different host names for tenants. In this case, you have to set up URL rewriting in the web.config file for the [!INCLUDE[webserver](../developer/includes/webserver.md)]. For more information, see [Configuring [!INCLUDE[webserver](../developer/includes/webserver.md)] to Accept Host Names for Tenants](configure-web-server-to-accept-host-names-for-tenants.md).

### Using Visual Studio Code

If you're connecting to your solution from Visual Studio Code, then you must also specify the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] server config parameter `ValidAudiences` and set it to `https://api.businesscentral.dynamics.com`. If you don't do this step, you'll get the error `securitytokeninvalidaudienceexception` in the application log when trying to download symbols.


### Give users guidance about single sign-on

Single sign-on means that users are still signed in to Microsoft Entra ID when they sign out from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)], unless they close all browser windows. However, if a user selected the **Keep me signed in** field when they signed in, they're still signed in when they close the browser window. To fully sign out from Microsoft Entra ID, the user must sign out from each application that uses Microsoft Entra ID, including [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] and SharePoint.  

We recommend that you provide guidance to your users for signing out of their account when they're done. Doing so will help you keep your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] deployment more secure.
