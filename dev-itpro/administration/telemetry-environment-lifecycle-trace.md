# Analyzing Environment Lifecycle Trace Telemetry

[!INCLUDE[component](../developer/includes/online_only.md)]

[!INCLUDE[azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id](~/../shared-content/shared/azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id.md)]

Environment lifecycle telemetry gathers data about the success or failure of the following environment-related operations:

- Update an environment
- Start/stop/restart an environment
- Copy an environment
- Point-in-time restore an environment
- Move an environment to a difference Microsoft Entra tenant
- Cancel a session from the Business Central admin center
- Export the environment database
- Change the environment configuration 
- Delete an environment
- Rename an environment

Telemetry is also gathered on the following data update events:

- Data upgrade started
- Data upgrade succeeded
- Data upgrade failed
- Data upgrade recovery succeeded
- Data upgrade recovery failed

Failed operations result in a trace log entry that includes a reason for the failure.

### Custom dimensions available in all events

The following dimensions are available in all events described below and aren't included in the individual event documentation:
