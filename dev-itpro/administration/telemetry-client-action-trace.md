# Analyzing client action telemetry

**INTRODUCED IN:** [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] 2023 release wave 1, version 22.0. 

Client action telemetry gathers data about actions that users select on pages in the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] client. Each action event tells you the type of action, on which page it was triggered, information about the user's environment, and more.

Use the data to gather statistics about usage of client features by users.


## Client action invoked

Occurs when an action on a page in the client was invoked.  

### General dimensions

The pageViews table is a built-in table in Application Insights. Here are some of the fields most used in analysis of the signal:

|Field|Description or value|
