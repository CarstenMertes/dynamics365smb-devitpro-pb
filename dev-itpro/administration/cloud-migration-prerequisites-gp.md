# Cloud migration prerequisites for Dynamics GP

This article outlines requirements on the [!INCLUDE [dyn_gp_prod](../includes/dyn_gp_prod.md)] on-premises and online environments for cloud migration. Review this information before you start the cloud migration. 

## Destination online environment

- Customer has a [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] online tenant  

- At least one user has *SUPER* permissions in the target company in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] online.

  Users assigned with *SUPER* permissions are the only users who can make changes in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] online target company. Users who don't have *SUPER* permissions will be automatically reassigned to the intelligent cloud user group, which limits them to read-only access to data. For more information, refer to [Working with environments during cloud migration](migrate-business-central-on-premises.md#working-with-environments-during-cloud-migration). 

  If you're the person who will set up and run the cloud migration, you must have *SUPER* permissions and admin role in Microsoft admin center. If you'll be running cloud migration as a delegated admin, a Business Central user with *SUPER* permissions will have to grant you permission. The permission is granted when you try to run the **Cloud Migration Setup**. For more information, see [About delegated administrators](migration-setup.md#about-delegated-administrators).

- Install the Business Central migration apps 

  In the [!INCLUDE [prodadmincenter](../developer/includes/prodadmincenter.md)], open the environment that you intend to migrate your data to, and then choose the **Apps** action. Make sure that these apps have the latest updates installed:

  - Intelligent Cloud Base  
  - [!INCLUDE [dyn_gp_prod](../includes/dyn_gp_prod.md)] Intelligent Cloud  
  - [!INCLUDE [dyn_gp_prod](../includes/dyn_gp_prod.md)] History SmartLists  

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > Migrating from [!INCLUDE [dyn_gp_prod](../includes/dyn_gp_prod.md)] using the **Cloud Migration Setup** assisted setup guide is currently only supported for the following markets:  
  >
  > * United States
  > * Canada
  > * United Kingdom
  > * Australia

## Source on-premises environment

- [!INCLUDE [dyn_gp_prod](../includes/dyn_gp_prod.md)] version is a supported migration path.

  If the solution is based on an older version of the on-premises product, upgrade to the latest supported version.

- Database

  The database can be hosted on SQL Server or Azure SQL Database.  

  An SQL Server database must meet the following requirements:
  - Uses SQL Server 2016 SP1 or later
  - Compatibility level set to 130 or higher
  - TCP/IP is enabled. For more information, refer to [Enable or Disable a Server Network Protocol](/sql/database-engine/configure-windows/enable-or-disable-a-server-network-protocol) in the SQL Server documentation. 
  - Configured for SQL Server authentication.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > The login account used for SQL server authentication must have the **sysadmin** role on the server level and **db_owner** role on the database level.

### Is a data upgrade needed?

A cloud migration can be performed either on a live system or from a backup. 
 
- For a migration from a live system, the database is running a production workload and must therefore use a non-developer SKU of SQL Server. This also means that if you are running your [!INCLUDE [dyn_gp_prod](../includes/dyn_gp_prod.md)] production environment on a SQL Server version 2014 or earlier, you need to upgrade the database before starting your cloud migration project. You might want to consider using a Azure SQL Managed Instance resource as a stepping stone because this type of Azure SQL database allows for importing a database backup and also supports most of the on-premises features of SQL Server. 
 
- For a migration from a backup, you can just restore the backup using a SQL Server 2022 (or later) developer edition and run the migration project from there, as long as you don't use that SQL Server for other workloads.


## Other

- Self-hosted integration runtime machine (local on-premises database only; not Azure Database Server)

   The computer from which you'll run the cloud migration and self-hosted integration runtime should meet the requirements described at [Create and configure a self-hosted integration runtime](/azure/data-factory/create-self-hosted-integration-runtime?tabs=data-factory#prerequisites).
