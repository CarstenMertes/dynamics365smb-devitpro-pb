# Environment Telemetry in the [!INCLUDE[prodadmincenter](../developer/includes/prodadmincenter.md)]

The [!INCLUDE[prodadmincenter](../developer/includes/prodadmincenter.md)] provides telemetry for the tenant environments to enable troubleshooting and support for the tenant. The Telemetry tab provides telemetry of top-level AL events, and any errors resulting from calls through the telemetry stack.

> [!TIP]
> If your users complain of a confusing error message such as *Sorry, we just updated this page. Please close and reopen.*, then you can often find the underlying problem by analyzing telemetry in the [!INCLUDE [prodadmincenter](../developer/includes/prodadmincenter.md)]. For example, in the case of the *Sorry, we just updated this page. Please close and reopen.* message, the underlying problem is often that two users are trying to modify the same data. So if both users open the same sales order, and both change a field, then one of them will see the *Sorry, we just updated this page. Please close and reopen.* message, because [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] saves changes as soon as you move to the next field or close the page.

## Filter by environment

To filter the telemetry for an environment:

1. Select a base point-in-time for the timestamp of the telemetry messages.
2. Enter a number of minutes before or after the base point-in-time to set a range of time for the timestamp. A negative number indicates a number of minutes before the base point-in-time, and a positive number indicates a number of minutes following the base point-in-time. For example, a value of *-15* filters messages to a timestamp range of up to 15 minutes before the base point-in-time.
3. Choose the message type.
4. Choose the environment.
5. Select **Filter**.

## Enable richer telemetry

[!INCLUDE[2019_releasewave2.md](../includes/2019_releasewave2.md)]

Get richer telemetry to help you troubleshoot by sending telemetry to Microsoft Azure Application Insights. For more information, see [Enable Sending Telemetry to Application Insights](telemetry-enable-application-insights.md#appinsights).

Application Insights is a service hosted within Azure that gathers telemetry data for analysis and presentation. For more information, see [What is Application Insights?](/azure/azure-monitor/app/app-insights-overview).

For an overview of the telemetry types that are currently emitted, see [Monitoring and Analyzing with Telemetry](telemetry-overview.md).

[!INCLUDE [admin-appinsights-germany](../includes/admin-appinsights-germany.md)]

<!--
### <a name="lrsql"></a>Analyze long running SQL queries

Any SQL query that takes longer than 1000 milliseconds to execute will be sent to your Application Insights resource. To get a quick overview, you can go the [Application Insights Overview dashboard](/azure/azure-monitor/app/overview-dashboard).

For details about the long running SQL query telemetry information and dimensions sent from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)], see [Dimensions for long running SQL queries](monitor-long-running-sql-queries-event-log.md#LRSQLQuery).

There are multiple reasons that can affect the time it takes SQL queries to run. For example, the database could be waiting for a lock to be released or the database is executing an operation that performs badly because of missing indexes. In some cases, you can see what caused the delay by looking at the SQL statement that was generated by the code. This information can be found in the **CustomDimension** data, specifically the **AL Stack Trace** column.
