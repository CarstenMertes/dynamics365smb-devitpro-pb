# Get Started as a Reseller of Business Central Online

If you want to build your business on [!INCLUDE [prod_long](../developer/includes/prod_long.md)] online, you must get set up as a reseller in the Microsoft Partner Center. In this article, we take you through the first steps in your journey.  

## Step 1: Become a partner

Becoming a Microsoft partner gives you access to the Microsoft resources needed to sell solutions. The steps in this section below are required to gain access to the programs that enable are intended to help you get set up to sell [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)].

In order to be able to service [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] licenses and provide help and support to your customers, your company must have a [Microsoft Partner ID](/partner-center/mpn-overview) (MPN ID), and you must enroll in the [Cloud Solution Provider](/partner-center/csp-overview) (CSP) program.

[!INCLUDE [admin-partner-mpn](../developer/includes/admin-partner-mpn.md)]

[!INCLUDE [csp-get-started](../developer/includes/csp-get-started.md)]

[!INCLUDE [csp-admin-users](../developer/includes/csp-admin-users.md)]

> [!CAUTION]
> [!INCLUDE [admin-partneruser](../developer/includes/admin-partneruser.md)]

For more information, see [Delegated Administrator Access to Business Central Online](delegated-admin.md).  

## Step 2: Go to market

When you become a Microsoft Partner Network member, you gain access to membership benefits that can help you build and grow your business. For more information, see [Explore your Go-To-Market with Microsoft offers](/partner-center/mpn-learn-about-go-to-market-benefits) in the Partner Center docs.  

As a Dynamics 365 reseller, you benefit from Microsoft's investments in an always up-to-date modern platform, you can bundle recognized apps from the Microsoft commercial marketplace into an offering that fits the needs of your customers, reach more customers by using Microsoft's commercial marketplace to promote your packaged consulting service offerings or customization services, and streamline your own processes and build tools with Power BI, Power Automate, and Power Apps connected to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)].  

The [Dynamics 365 Business Central Partner Portal](https://dynamicspartners.transform.microsoft.com/products/dynamics-365-business-central) landing site has plenty of material to help you build a practice, go to market, drive readiness, and keep track of upcoming events (requires a partner account).  

### Marketing assets

Microsoft provides marketing assets that you can use to build a business based on Microsoft. For more information, see the following sites:

* [Partner Network resources](https://partner.microsoft.com/asset#/?type=marketing-campaigns&area=mrkt)  
* [Brand and trademark basics for partners](https://partner.microsoft.com/marketing/branding)  
* [Go-to-market with Microsoft](https://partner.microsoft.com/solutions/go-to-market)  

Specifically for going to market with [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)], Microsoft provides resources and guidance on the [Business Applications for small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs)](https://partner.microsoft.com/solutions/business-applications/smb) site. For more information, see [Business Central Go-To-Market resources](https://partner.microsoft.com/asset/collection/business-central-go-to-market-resources#/).  

## Step 3: Give powerful demos

You can create a trial environment based on content in [cdx.transform.microsoft.com](https://cdx.transform.microsoft.com/).  

For more information, see [Preparing Demonstration Environments of [!INCLUDE[prod_long](../developer/includes/prod_long.md)]](../administration/demo-environment.md).  

## Step 4: Help your customers get started

When you onboard customers to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)], you have access to their account as a delegated administrator and can help them get things set up. For more information, see [Administration of Business Central Online](tenant-administration.md).  

### Connect with customers

[!INCLUDE [csp-connect-customer](../developer/includes/csp-connect-customer.md)]
[!INCLUDE [csp-disconnect-customer](../developer/includes/csp-disconnect-customer.md)]

### Get Business Central right for the customer

The default version of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] is just that - a default version. In many cases, you'll enhance the default version with [apps from the Microsoft commercial marketplace](/dynamics365/business-central/ui-extensions). But you can also [customize pages for a profile](/dynamics365/business-central/ui-personalization-manage) and [change which UI elements are visible](/dynamics365/business-central/ui-experiences). For more information, see [Customize Business Central](/dynamics365/business-central/ui-customizing-overview) in the business functionality content.  

If your customer wants more tweaks, you can create customizations of profiles and pages in code. For more information, see [Customizing the User Interface for User Roles](../developer/devenv-role-customization.md) in the developer content.  

You can also use [configuration packages](set-up-standard-company-configuration-packages.md) to quickly apply the same settings as usual to new environments.

### Move the customer from a trial to a paid subscription

If your customer decides to start using [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] to run their business, they must switch to a paid subscription. Both the internal admin and the delegated admin can assign licenses to users in the Microsoft 365 admin center. For more information, see [Buy or remove licenses](/microsoft-365/commerce/licenses/buy-licenses?view=o365-worldwide&preserve-view=true) in the Microsoft 365 content.  

[!INCLUDE [admin-license-trial](../includes/admin-license-trial.md)]

If the customer has tried out [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] using a pre-configured demonstration company that [you have prepared](demo-environment.md) in other ways, they can now sign up for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] using their own work or school account so that you can assign the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] license to their Microsoft 365 tenant.  

You can help them migrate their data from their legacy system. For more information, see [Migrate On-Premises Data to Business Central Online](migrate-data.md).

## Step 5: Configure the support experience

As a [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] reselling partner, you are an administrator of your customers' [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] tenants, and you are the first line of support. This means that you will get requests for support from your customers that you must triage, investigate, and either resolve or escalate to Microsoft.  

[!INCLUDE [admin-supportplan](../includes/admin-supportplan.md)]

For more information, see [Technical Support for Business Central](../technical-support.md) and [Managing Technical Support](manage-technical-support.md).  

## Step 6: Maintain your customers' Business Central

As a Business Central reselling partner, you are the administrator of the Business Central tenants of your customers. You are expected to help your customers maintain their solution, including [setting the upgrade window](tenant-admin-center-update-management.md#set-the-update-window-for-each-environment), [monitoring telemetry](tenant-admin-center-telemetry.md), [updating customizations](../developer/app-maintain.md), and [managing apps](tenant-admin-center-manage-apps.md).  

For more information, see [Administration of Business Central Online](tenant-administration.md) and [The Business Central Administration Center](tenant-admin-center.md).
