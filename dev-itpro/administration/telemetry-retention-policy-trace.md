# Analyzing retention policy trace telemetry

**APPLIES TO:** [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] 2020 release wave 2, update 17.1 and later

[!INCLUDE[azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id](~/../shared-content/shared/azure-ad-to-microsoft-entra-id.md)]

Administrators define retention policies to specify how frequently they want [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] to delete outdated data in tables that contain log entries and archived records. For example, cleaning up log entries makes it easier to work with the data that's relevant. Policies can include all data in the tables that is past the expiration date. Or you can add filter criteria to include only certain expired data in the policy.

To gather this telemetry data, you have to set up retention policies on tables that contain log entries and archived records. For more information, see [Define Retention Policies](/dynamics365/business-central/admin-data-retention-policies) in the Application help.

Telemetry is then logged for the following operations:

- A table is added to the list of allowed tables
- An error occurs when adding a new retention policy
- A retention policy is enabled
- A retention policy is applied, either manually or automatically
- Data is deleted because of a retention policy
- The first retention policy is enabled on a table in a company
- The last retention policy is removed in a company

## <a name="info"></a>Retention policy log entry logged

Occurs when a retention policy is enabled, applied, or disabled. It provides information about the different operations related to the retention policy. This information is similar to what you see in the **Retention Policy Log** page in the client.

### General dimensions

|---------|-----|
|message|**Retention Policy Log Entry Logged: {alMessageType}**|
|severityLevel|**1** for error, **2** for warning, **3** for info|
|user_Id|[!INCLUDE[user_Id](../includes/include-telemetry-user-id.md)] |

### Custom dimensions

|Dimension|Description or value|
|---------|-----|
|eventId|**AL0000D3L**|
|alCategory|Specifies the aspect of the retention policy that created the log entry. For example, it can be related to setup, the retention period, and when the policy was applied. Some of the values are: **Retention Policy - Setup**, **Retention Policy - Apply**, **Retention Policy - Schedule**, **Retention Policy - Allowed Tables**.|
|alCompanyName|Specifies the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] company that the retention policy applies to.|
|alLogEntry|Specifies message about the retention policy execution step, for example: Table 405 Change Log Entry was added to the list of allowed tables. Default Date Field No.: 2000000001|
|alMessageType|Specifies the message type for the log entry: <ul><li>**Error** - indicates an error occurred and the operation was unsuccessful</li><li>**Warning** - indicates that the operation succeeded but there's a warning</li><li> **Info** - indicates that the operation was successful.|
