# Delete subscriptions

[!INCLUDE[api_v2_note](../../../includes/api_v2_note.md)]

Deletes a subscriptions object for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../../includes/prod_short.md)].

## Custom APIs

If you've created custom entities, the URL that you use for the request and the `resource` part of the request must include the `<APIPublisher>`, `<APIGroup>`, and `<APIVersion>` elements equivalent to: `api/<APIPublisher>/<APIGroup>/<APIVersion>/subscriptions`. For example, if your API publisher is `pub`, your API group is `grp`, and the version is 1.0, part of the URL will contain these elements `api/pub/grp/v1.0/subscriptions`.

## HTTP request

Replace the URL prefix for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../../includes/prod_short.md)] depending on environment following the [guideline](../endpoints-apis-for-dynamics.md).
```
DELETE businesscentralPrefix/subscriptions({'id'})
```
