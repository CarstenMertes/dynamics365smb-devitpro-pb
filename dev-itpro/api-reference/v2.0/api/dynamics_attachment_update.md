# Update attachments

Update the attachment in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../../includes/prod_short.md)]. An attachment in the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../../includes/prod_short.md)] API is defined as an Incoming Document (table 130).


## HTTP request
Replace the URL prefix for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../../includes/prod_short.md)] depending on environment following the [guideline](../../v2.0/endpoints-apis-for-dynamics.md).

```

|Header|Value|
