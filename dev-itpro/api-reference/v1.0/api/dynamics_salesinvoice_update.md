# Update salesInvoices (v1.0)

## HTTP request
Replace the URL prefix for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../../includes/prod_short.md)] depending on environment following the [guideline](../../v1.0/endpoints-apis-for-dynamics.md).

```
PATCH businesscentralPrefix/companies({id})/salesInvoices({id})
```

## Request headers (v1.0)

|--------------|-------------------------|
|Authorization |Bearer {token}. Required.|
|Content-Type  |application/json         |
|If-Match      |Required. When this request header is included and the eTag provided does not match the current tag on the **salesInvoices**, the **salesInvoices** will not be updated. |

## Request body (v1.0)

Existing properties that are not included in the request body will maintain their previous values or be recalculated based on changes to other property values.
