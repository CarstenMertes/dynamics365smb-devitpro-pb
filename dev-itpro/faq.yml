      - question: Can I request a copy of the backup of my production database?

          No, but from the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] administration center, you can export the database for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online environments as \.bacpac files to an Azure storage container. For more information, see [Exporting Databases](administration/tenant-admin-center-database-export.md).

      - question: Can I get training in Business Central?
        answer: |
          Yes, you can. Find free eLearning content on the [Microsoft Learn site](/learn/dynamics365/business-central?WT.mc_id=dyn365bc_landingpage-docs).

You can also create a sandbox environment and use Visual Studio Code to debug that. For more information, see [Managing Technical Support](administration/manage-technical-support.md).

      - question: How does Microsoft handle database sizes?
        answer: |
          For [!INCLUDE [prod_short](developer/includes/prod_short.md)] online, there's a limit to how much database storage capacity we allow each tenant to use for their environments (databases).

          [!INCLUDE [db-storage-limit](includes/db-storage-limit.md)]

          For more information, see [Managing capacity](administration/tenant-admin-center-capacity.md).

      - question: Why doesn't the Outlook add-in work for my users?
        answer: |
          The Outlook add-in is designed to function as a business inbox in Outlook, based on the standard [!INCLUDE [prod_short](developer/includes/prod_short.md)] online. If you're using a different type of deployment, such as a solution that is part of the Embed App program, then you must set up an Azure Key Vault and specify secrets for TEMPORARYDOCUMENTSTORAGEACCOUNT and TEMPORARYDOCUMENTSTORAGEKEY. For more information, see [Using Key Vault Secrets in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](developer/includes/prod_short.md)] Extensions](developer/devenv-app-key-vault.md).

      - question: Is the Windows client supported?
        answer: |
          The first releases of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on premises included an installed client derived from Microsoft Dynamics NAV. Since 2019 release wave 2, this legacy component, referred to as "the Windows client", hasn't been available for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For more information, see [FAQ About the Windows Client and Business Central](faq-win-cli.md).

      - question: What's going on with the Help?
        answer: |
          If you have a background with [!INCLUDE [navnow_md](developer/includes/navnow_md.md)], you'll find that in-product Help is different in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](developer/includes/prod_short.md)]. For more information, see [User Assistance Model](user-assistance.md).

      - question: Where can I find partner-only assets and links?
        answer: |
          If you were familiar with PartnerSource, then the new [Dynamics 365 Business Central Partner Portal](https://dynamicspartners.transform.microsoft.com/products/dynamics-365-business-central) site is different. But it hosts many useful links and other assets that can help you ramp up on what's going on with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The site requires that you sign in with a partner account. Some assets are marked as confidential and can't be shared with clients.
      - question: Which IP addresses or ranges does my environment's API use?
        answer: |
          When you exchange data through the API, you might have to safe list the IP addresses. The addresses depend on the direction of the call.

          - Inbound

            Inbound requests go into the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] API, for example through OData calls. The requests go to the `https://api.businesscentral.dynamics.com` URL that currently resolves to IP addresses in the IP ranges of the following Azure regions:

            - Australia East
            - West Europe
            - Switzerland North
            - East US
            - South Central US

            > [!IMPORTANT]
            > Data routed through `https://api.businesscentral.dynamics.com` isn't *stored* in these regions. The data *transits* through them.

            We reserve the right to change the list of Azure regions used by the `https://api.businesscentral.dynamics.com` URL without prior announcement. We will, however, update this guidance accordingly once such a change is implemented.

          - Outbound

            Outbound requests come from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] environment, such as code that uses the `HttpClient`data type to send HTTP requests. The requests come from an IP address in the IP ranges of the Azure region in which the environment is hosted. You can see where an environment is hosted on the **Environment details** page in the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] admin center. For more information, see [Managing Environments](administration/tenant-admin-center-environments.md).

          You can find the IP addresses of the Azure regions [as a download on the Download center](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=56519). Search for the `AzureCloud.<region name>` sections in the file to find the corresponding IP ranges, such as *AzureCloud.westeurope*.
