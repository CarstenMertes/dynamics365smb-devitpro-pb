# Upgrading to [!INCLUDE[prod_long](../developer/includes/prod_long.md)] On-Premises Spring 2019 (v.14)

[!INCLUDE [upgrade-14](../includes/upgrade-14.md)]

The upgrade process depends on different factors, such as the version of [!INCLUDE[navnow](../developer/includes/navnow_md.md)] that you are upgrading from, and the degree to which your solution differs from the standard version of [!INCLUDE[navnow](../developer/includes/navnow_md.md)]. The mains tasks range from converting the database to upgrading application code and data.

Use the following table to determine the procedures that you must complete for your upgrade scenario:

|  Scenario  |  Tasks  |
|------------|--------------|
|Full upgrade from one of the following versions:<ul><li>  [!INCLUDE[navcrete](../developer/includes/navcrete_md.md)]</li><li>[!INCLUDE[navcorfu](../developer/includes/navcorfu_md.md)]</li><li>[!INCLUDE[nav2017](../developer/includes/nav2017.md)]</li><li>[!INCLUDE[nav2018_md](../developer/includes/nav2018_md.md)]</li><li>[!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] October 2018</li></ul>|From these versions, you can upgrade directly to the latest version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] by following these tasks:<ol><li>[Upgrade the Application Code](Upgrading-the-Application-Code.md)</li><li>[Upgrade the Data](Upgrading-the-Data.md)</li></ol>|
|Full upgrade from one of the following versions:<ul><li>[!INCLUDE[nav7long](../developer/includes/nav7long_md.md)]</li><li>[!INCLUDE[navsicily](../developer/includes/navsicily_md.md)]</li></ul>|<ol><li>Upgrade to [!INCLUDE[nav2018_md](../developer/includes/nav2018_md.md)].</br></br>For more information, see [Upgrading to Microsoft Dynamics NAV 2018](/dynamics-nav/upgrading-to-microsoft-dynamics-nav).</li><li>Upgrade to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)].<ol><li>[Upgrade the Application Code](Upgrading-the-Application-Code.md)</li><li>[Upgrade the Data: Single-Tenant Deployment](Upgrading-the-Data.md) or [Upgrade the Data: Multitenant Deployment](Upgrading-the-Data-Multitenant.md)</li></ol></li></ol>|
|Full upgrade from one of the following versions:<ul><li>  [!INCLUDE[nav2009sp1](../developer/includes/nav2009sp1_md.md)]</li><li>[!INCLUDE[nav2009r2](../developer/includes/nav2009r2_md.md)]</li><li>  [!INCLUDE[nav_5](../developer/includes/nav_5_md.md)]</li><li>   [!INCLUDE[nav_4](../developer/includes/nav_4_md.md)]</li></ul>|There are two different upgrade paths to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)], depending on the version you are upgrading from. For [!INCLUDE[nav_5](../developer/includes/nav_5_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[nav_4](../developer/includes/nav_4_md.md)], you must go through [!INCLUDE[nav7long](../developer/includes/nav7long_md.md)]. For [!INCLUDE[nav2009sp1](../developer/includes/nav2009sp1_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[nav2009r2](../developer/includes/nav2009r2_md.md)], you can choose to go through [!INCLUDE[nav7long](../developer/includes/nav7long_md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[navcrete](../developer/includes/navcrete_md.md)]<br /><br />**Through [!INCLUDE[nav7long](../developer/includes/nav7long_md.md)]**<ol><li>Upgrade to [!INCLUDE[nav7long](../developer/includes/nav7long_md.md)].</br></br>For more information, see [Upgrading to Microsoft Dynamics NAV 2013](/previous-versions/dynamicsnav-2013/hh169484(v=nav.70)) in Previous Versions Documentation.</li><li>Upgrade to [!INCLUDE[nav2018_md](../developer/includes/nav2018_md.md)].</br></br>For more information, see [Upgrading to Microsoft Dynamics NAV 2018](/dynamics-nav/upgrading-to-microsoft-dynamics-nav).</li><li>Upgrade to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)].<ol><li>[Upgrade the Application Code](Upgrading-the-Application-Code.md)</li><li>[Upgrade the Data: Single-Tenant Deployment](Upgrading-the-Data.md) or [Upgrade the Data: Multitenant Deployment](Upgrading-the-Data-Multitenant.md)</li></ol></li></ol><br /><br />**Through [!INCLUDE[navcrete](../developer/includes/navcrete_md.md)]**<ol><li>Upgrade to [!INCLUDE[navcrete](../developer/includes/navcrete_md.md)].</br></br>For more information, see  [Microsoft Dynamics 365 Blog](https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/no-audience/2015/02/23/upgrading-from-microsoft-dynamics-nav-2009-r2-or-microsoft-dynamics-nav-2009-sp1-to-microsoft-dynamics-nav-2015/) or [Upgrading to Microsoft Dynamics NAV 2015](/previous-versions/dynamicsnav-2015/dn271649(v=nav.80)).</li><li>Upgrade to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)].<ol><li>[Upgrade the Application Code](Upgrading-the-Application-Code.md)</li><li>[Upgrade the Data: Single-Tenant Deployment](Upgrading-the-Data.md) or [Upgrade the Data: Multitenant Deployment](Upgrading-the-Data-Multitenant.md)</li></ol></li></ol>After the upgrade, links between interaction records and logged email messages is lost. To resolve this issue, the administrator has to log all mails again to restore the links.

## Automating the Upgrade Process using Sample Windows PowerShell Scripts
You can use [!INCLUDE[wps_2](../developer/includes/wps_2_md.md)] scripts to help you upgrade to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)]. You can use automation to upgrade a single [!INCLUDE[navnow](../developer/includes/navnow_md.md)] database as well as multiple [!INCLUDE[navnow](../developer/includes/navnow_md.md)] databases that use the same application. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] provides sample scripts that you can adapt for your deployment architecture.
