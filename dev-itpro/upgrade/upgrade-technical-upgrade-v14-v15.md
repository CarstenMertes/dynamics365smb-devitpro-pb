# Technical Upgrade to [!INCLUDE[prolong](../developer/includes/prod_long.md)] 2019 Wave 2

<!--

-->
Use this process when you have a code customized [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] application (version 14) that you want to upgrade to the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] 2019 release wave 2 platform (version 15). This process won't upgrade the application to the latest version. You'll convert the entire application from C/AL to an AL base application extension.

<!-- For this scenario, I used a BC 14.0 modified base application on a BC 14.0 server instance, which include some customization on C/AL objects in the base application and a custom extension that modified the Item table. is proecess will convert the entire BC 14 custom application to an Extension on the BC 15 platform.-->

 ![Upgrade on customized Business Central application.](../developer/media/bc15-upgrade-customized-app.png "Upgrade on customize Business Central application")  
 

#### Single-tenant and multitenant deployments

[!INCLUDE[upgrade_single_vs_multitenant](../developer/includes/upgrade_single_vs_multitenant.md)]

## Prerequisites

1. Upgrade to Business Central Spring 2019 (version 14).

   There are several updates for version 14. When upgrading from Business Central Fall 2018 (version 13) or Dynamics NAV, upgrade to the latest version 14 update that has a compatible version 15 update. For more information, see [[!INCLUDE[prod_long](../developer/includes/prod_long.md)] Upgrade Compatibility Matrix](upgrade-v14-v15-compatibility.md).
   
   If your solution is already on version 14, then you don't have to upgrade to the latest version 15 update.

   To download the latest update, go to [Released Cumulative Updates for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central Spring 2019 Update on-premises](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4501292).

   For information, see [Upgrading to Dynamics 365 Business Central On-Premises](upgrading-to-business-central-on-premises.md).

2. Disable data encryption.

    If the current server instance uses data encryption, disable it. You can enable it again after upgrading.

    For more information, see [Managing Encryption and Encryption Keys](how-to-export-and-import-encryption-keys.md#encryption).

    Instead of disabling encryption, you can export the current encryption key, which you'll then import after upgrade. However, we recommend disabling encryption before upgrading.

<!-- Replace step 1 with this for CU1
1. Upgrade to the latest Business Central Spring 2019 Cumulative Update (version 14.X) that is compatible with the version 15 .

   If your current deployment is already running cumulative update 5 (version 14.6), we recommend to wait until the first cumulative update for version 15 is released. This is recommended because of destructive schema changes introduced by version 15 Base Application.

 For more information, see [Upgrading to Dynamics 365 Business Central On-Premises](upgrading-to-business-central-on-premises.md).

-->
## Task 1: Install [!INCLUDE[prod_long](../developer/includes/prod_long.md)] 2019 release wave 2 (version 15.0)

1. Before you install version 15, it can be useful to create desktop shortcuts to the version 14.0 tools, such as the [!INCLUDE[admintool](../developer/includes/admintool.md)], [!INCLUDE[adminshell](../developer/includes/adminshell.md)], and [!INCLUDE[devshell](../developer/includes/devshell.md)] because the Start menu items for these tools will be replaced with the version 15.0 tools.

2. Install all components of Business Central 2019 release wave 2 (version 15).

    If you didn't uninstall version 14.0, then you must either specify different port numbers for components during installation or stop the version 14.0 [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] instance before you run the installation. Otherwise, you'll get an error that the [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] failed to install.

    <!--
    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Because of dependencies, we recommend that for upgrade , you install all components available. Also, there is currently a known issue with the Microsoft.Office.Interop.Word.dll. After installation, you must copy the Microsoft.Office.Interop.Word.dll from the C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central\150\RoleTailored Client folder to the C:\Program Files\Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central\150\Service\Add-ins folder.-->

    For more information, see [Installing Business Central Using Setup](../deployment/install-using-setup.md).

3. Copy the version 14 **CodeViewer** add-in to the version 15.0 server installation.

    1. Find the **CodeViewer** folder in the **Add-ins** folder of the version 14 RoleTailored client installation. By default, the folder path is C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central\140\RoleTailored Client\Add-ins.
    
    2. Copy the folder to the **Add-ins** folder of the version 15 server installation. By default, the folder path is C:\Program Files\Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central\150\Service\Add-ins. Replace the existing folder and files, if any. 
     
    CodeViewer is no longer used in version 15. But it's required because of references that exist in the converted application. If you omit this step, you might get compilation errors later.

## Task 2: Convert your application from C/AL to AL

Convert your solution from C/AL code to AL code. For more information, see [Code Conversion from C/AL to AL](devenv-code-conversion.md).

## <a name="Preparedb"></a> Task 3: Prepare the application database for technical upgrade

1. Make backup of the database.
2. Make sure that you have the extension packages for all published extensions.

    You'll need these packages later to publish and install the extensions again.
3. Uninstall all extensions from the old tenants.

    Run the [!INCLUDE[adminshell](../developer/includes/adminshell.md)] for version 14.0 as an administrator. To uninstall an extension, you use the [Uninstall-NAVApp](/powershell/module/microsoft.dynamics.nav.apps.management/uninstall-navapp) cmdlet. For example, together with the Get-NAVAppInfo cmdlet, you can uninstall all extensions with a single command:

    ``` 
    Get-NAVAppInfo -ServerInstance <BC14 server instance> -Tenant <tenant ID> | % { Uninstall-NAVApp -ServerInstance <BC14 server instance> -Name $_.Name -Version $_.Version -Tenant <tenant ID>}
    ``` 

    If you have a single tenant deployment, you can omit the `-Tenant` parameter and value. 

3. Unpublish all extensions from the application server instance.

    To unpublish extensions, use the [Unpublish-NAVAPP cmdlet](/powershell/module/microsoft.dynamics.nav.apps.management/unpublish-navapp). Together with the [Get-NAVAppInfo cmdlet](/powershell/module/microsoft.dynamics.nav.apps.management/get-navappinfo?view=businesscentral-ps), you can uninstall all extensions from the tenant using a single command:

    ```
    Get-NAVAppInfo -ServerInstance <BC14 server instance> | % { Unpublish-NAVApp -ServerInstance <BC14 server instance> -Name $_.Name -Version $_.Version }
    ```

4. Unpublish all system, test, and application symbols.

    To unpublish symbols, use the Unpublish-NAVAPP cmdlet. You can unpublish all symbols by using the Get-NAVAppInfo cmdlet with the `-SymbolsOnly` switch as follows:

    ``` 
    Get-NAVAppInfo -ServerInstance <BC14 server instance> -SymbolsOnly | % { Unpublish-NAVApp -ServerInstance <BC14 server instance> -Name $_.Name -Version $_.Version }
    ```    

    [What are symbols?](upgrade-overview-v15.md#Symbols)  

5. (Multitenant only) Dismount the tenants from the application server instance.

    To dismount a tenant, use the [Dismount-NAVTenant](/powershell/module/microsoft.dynamics.nav.management/dismount-navtenant) cmdlet:

    ```
    Dismount-NAVTenant -ServerInstance <BC14 server instance> -Tenant <tenant ID>
    ```

6. Stop the server instance.

    ```
    Stop-NAVServerInstance -ServerInstance <BC14 server instance>
    ```

## Task 4: Convert the version 14.0 application database to the version 15.0 platform

This task runs a technical upgrade on the application database. A technical upgrade converts the database from the version 14.0 platform to the version 15.0 platform. This conversion updates the system tables of the database to the new schema (data structure). It also provides the latest platform features and performance enhancements.

[!INCLUDE[convert_azure_sql_db](../developer/includes/convert_azure_sql_db.md)]
2. Start [!INCLUDE[adminshell](../developer/includes/adminshell.md)] for version 15.0 as an administrator.

   [!INCLUDE[open-admin-shell](../developer/includes/open-admin-shell.md)]
3. Run the [Invoke-NAVApplicationDatabaseConversion cmdlet](/powershell/module/microsoft.dynamics.nav.management/invoke-navapplicationdatabaseconversion) to start the conversion:

    ```powershell
    Invoke-NAVApplicationDatabaseConversion -DatabaseServer <database server>\<database instance> -DatabaseName "<BC14 database name>"
    ```
    When completed, a message like the following displays in the console:

    ```
    DatabaseServer      : .\BCDEMO
    DatabaseName        : Demo Database BC (14-0)
    DatabaseCredentials :
    DatabaseLocation    :
    Collation           :
    ```

[!INCLUDE[convert_azure_sql_db_timeout](../developer/includes/convert_azure_sql_db_timeout.md)]

## Task 5: Connect and configure the version 15 server instance

When you installed version 15 in **Task 1**, a version 15 [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] instance was created. In this task, you change server configuration settings that are required to complete the upgrade. Some of the changes are only required for version 14 to version 15.0 upgrade and can be reverted after you complete the upgrade.

1. If the database is on Azure SQL Database, add your user account to the **dbmanager** database role on the master database.

    This membership is only required for converting the database, and can be removed afterwards. This step isn't required for Azure SQL Manage Instance.
2. Set the server instance to connect to the application database.

    ```
    Set-NAVServerConfiguration -ServerInstance <BC15 server instance> -KeyName DatabaseName -KeyValue "<BC14 database name>"
    ```
    
    In a single tenant deployment, this command mounts the tenant automatically. For more information, see [Connecting a Server Instance to a Database](../administration/connect-server-to-database.md).

3. Disable task scheduler on the server instance for purposes of upgrade.

    ```
    Set-NavServerConfiguration -ServerInstance <BC15 server instance> -KeyName "EnableTaskScheduler" -KeyValue false
    ```
    Be sure to re-enable task scheduler after upgrade if needed.

4. Restart the server instance.

    ```
    Restart-NAVServerInstance -ServerInstance <BC15 server instance>
    ```

## Task 6: Publish system symbols, base application, and test library extensions

In this task, you'll publish extensions to the version 15.0 server instance. Publishing adds the extension to the application database that is mounted on the server instance. The extension is then available for installing on tenants later. It updates internal tables, compiles the components of the extension behind-the-scenes, and builds the necessary metadata objects that are used at runtime.

The steps in this task continue to use the [!INCLUDE[adminshell](../developer/includes/adminshell.md)] for version 15.0 that you started in the previous task.

<!--
1. Increase the application version of the application database, and restart the server instance.

    Use the [Set-NAVApplication](/powershell/module/microsoft.dynamics.nav.management/set-navapplication) cmdlet to increase the application version number of the database to the version 15.0 application version.

    ```
    Set-NAVApplication BC150 -ApplicationVersion 15.0.0.0 -force
    ```

    ```
    Restart-NAVServerInstance -ServerInstance BC150
    ```
-->
1. Publish the system symbols extension for version 15.

    The symbols extension contains the required platform symbols that the base application depends on. The symbols extension package is called **System.app**. You find it where the **AL Development Environment** is installed. The default installation path is C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central\150\AL Development Environment.  

    ```
    Publish-NAVApp -ServerInstance <BC15 server instance> -Path "<path to the System.app file>" -PackageType SymbolsOnly
    ```
2. Publish the custom base application extension that you created in **Task 2**.

    ```
    Publish-NAVApp -ServerInstance <BC15 server instance> -Path "<path to the base application extension package file>"
    ```

3. Publish the test library extension if you created one in **Task 2**.

    ```
    Publish-NAVApp -ServerInstance <BC15 server instance> -Path "<path to the test library extension package file>"
    ```
<!--
## Task 7: Increase the application version in the database (optional) 

The application database includes the **$ndo$dbproperty** table which stores the application version. In the client, the application version is shown the Help and Support page. This information can be useful for support. The application version number is not automatically increased during upgrade. Although this step is not necessary for upgrading 

The Get-NavApplication cmdlet comes from the $ndo$dbproperty table in the database.

To increase the application version of the application database, use the [Set-NAVApplication](/powershell/module/microsoft.dynamics.nav.management/set-navapplication) cmdlet to increase the application version number of the database to the version 15.0 application version.

    ```
    Set-NAVApplication BC150 -ApplicationVersion 15.0.34737.0 -force
    ```
-->   
## Task 7: Synchronize tenant and synchronize/install base application and test library extensions

This task updates the tenant database schema with schema changes in system objects and application objects. You'll synchronize the tenant to the custom base application and test library extension (if any). When you synchronize the tenant, extensions take ownership of the tables in the SQL Database.

If you have a multitenant deployment, run these steps for each tenant (replacing `<tenant ID>` with the appropriate tenant ID).

1. (Multitenant only) Mount the tenant to the version 15 server instance.

    To mount the tenant, use the [Mount-NAVTenant](/powershell/module/microsoft.dynamics.nav.management/mount-navtenant) cmdlet:
    
    ```
    Mount-NAVTenant -ServerInstance <BC15 server instance> -DatabaseName "<BC14 database name>" -DatabaseServer <database server>\<database instance> -Tenant <tenant ID> -AllowAppDatabaseWrite
    ```
    
    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > You must use the same tenant ID for the tenant that was used in the old deployment; otherwise you will get an error when mounting or syncing the tenant. If you want to use a different ID for the tenant, you can either use the `-AlternateId` parameter now or after upgrading, dismount the tenant, then mount it again using the new ID and the `OverwriteTenantIdInDatabase` parameter.  
    
    > [!NOTE]  
    > For upgrade, we recommend that you use the `-AllowAppDatabaseWrite` parameter. After upgrade, you can dismount and mount the tenant again without the parameter if needed.

2. Synchronize the tenant to the system objects.
  
    Use the [Sync-NAVTenant](/powershell/module/microsoft.dynamics.nav.management/sync-navtenant) cmdlet:

    ```  
    Sync-NAVTenant -ServerInstance <BC15 server instance> -Tenant <tenant ID> -Mode Sync
    ```
    
    With a single-tenant deployment, you can omit the `-Tenant` parameter and value.

    At this stage, the tenant state is **Operational**.

3. Synchronize the tenant to the base application extension (Base Application).

    Use the [Sync-NAVApp](/powershell/module/microsoft.dynamics.nav.apps.management/sync-navapp) cmdlet:

    ```
    Sync-NAVApp -ServerInstance <BC15 server instance> -Name "Base Application" -Version <extension version> -tenant <tenant ID>
    ```

    With this step, the base app takes ownership of the database tables. When completed, in SQL Server, the table names will be suffixed with the base app extension ID.

4. Install custom base application extension on the tenant.

    To install the extension, you use the [Install-NAVApp cmdlet](/powershell/module/microsoft.dynamics.nav.apps.management/install-navapp). 

    ```
    Install-NAVApp -ServerInstance <BC15 server instance> -Name "Base Application" -Version <extension version>
    ```

    At this point, the base application is upgraded to the version 15 platform and is operational. You can open the application in the client.

5. Synchronize and install the test library extension.

    This step is like what you did for the custom base application in steps 3 and 4.


## Task 8: Configure the version 15 server instance for migrating extensions

In this task, you configure the version 15 server so that the Microsoft and third-party extensions that were installed in the version 14 deployment can be reinstalled. You'll configure the `DestinationAppsForMigration` parameter of the server instance with information about the custom base application and test library. Specifically, you need the appId, name, and publisher assigned to these extensions. With the `DestinationAppsForMigration` parameter set, when you publish the Microsoft and third-party extensions, the server instance will automatically modify the manifest of the extensions to include the dependency on the base application and test library extension, allowing them to be published.

1. Get the appId, name, and publisher of the custom base application and test library.

    ```
    Get-NAVAppInfo -ServerInstance <BC15 server instance>
    ```
2. Set the `DestinationAppsForMigration` parameter for the server instance configuration to include the information about the custom base application and test library (if used). For example:<!-- skip this step for now in single tenant-->

    ```
    Set-NAVServerConfiguration -ServerInstance <BC15 server instance> -KeyName "DestinationAppsForMigration" -KeyValue '[{"appId":"437dbf0e-84ff-417a-965d-ed2bb9650972", "name":"Base Application", "publisher": "Microsoft"},{"appId":"<test library extension app ID>", "name":"<test library extension name>", "publisher": "<test library publisher>"}]'
    ```
3. Restart the server instance.

<!--## Task 8: Publish, Sync and install Microsoft and third party extensions

Upgrading data updates the data that is stored in the tables of the tenant database to the schema changes that have been made to tables in application database and extensions. This step will also automatically install the **System Application** and **Base Application** extensions on the tenant.

1. To run the data upgrade, use the [Start-NavDataUpgrade](/powershell/module/microsoft.dynamics.nav.management/start-navdataupgrade) cmdlet:

    ```
    Start-NAVDataUpgrade -ServerInstance BC150 -Tenant default -FunctionExecutionMode Serial -SkipCompanyInitialization -SkipAppVersionCheck -Force
    ```        
    
    This step upgrades the data and installs the System Application and BaseApp extensions on the tenant. If you don't want to install the extensions, use the `-ExcludeExtensions` parameter. In this, case you will have to manually install these extensions before you complete the next step or to open the application in the client.
    
    > [!TIP]  
    >  In the last phase of data upgrade, all companies will be initialized by running codeunit 2 Company Initialization. This is done automatically. If you want to skip company initialization, then use the `Start-NavDataUpgrade` with the `-SkipCompanyIntitialization` parameter.
    
    To view the progress of the data upgrade, you can run Get-NavDataUpgrade cmdlet with the `–Progress` switch.
    
    When completed, the tenant state should be **Operational**.
2. (Single tenant only) When upgrade is completed, restart the server instance.

    You will see that the custom base application has been installed on the tenant.

The application should now be accessible from the client.-->

## Task 9: Publish, synchronize, and install extensions on the tenants

Now, you can install the Microsoft and 3rd-party extensions that were installed on the tenant before the upgrade.

1. Publish the old extension versions.

    ```
    Publish-NAVApp -ServerInstance <BC15 server instance> -Path "<path to extension package file>"
    ```

    You only need to do this step once.

2. Synchronize the extension.

    ```
    Sync-NAVApp -ServerInstance <BC15 server instance> -Name "<extension name>" -Version <extension version> -tenant <tenant ID>
    ```
3. Install the extension:

    ```
    Install-NAVApp -ServerInstance <BC15 server instance> -Name "<extension name>" -Version <extension version> -tenant <tenant ID>
    ```
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for each extension and on each tenant.

Now, your application is fully upgraded to the version 15 platform.

## Task 10: Post-upgrade

1. <a name="JSaddins"></a>Upgrade Javascript-based control add-ins to new versions.

    The [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] installation includes new versions of the following Microsoft-provided Javascript-based control add-ins that must be upgraded.
    
    - Microsoft.Dynamics.Nav.Client.BusinessChart
    - Microsoft.Dynamics.Nav.Client.FlowIntegration
    - Microsoft.Dynamics.Nav.Client.OAuthIntegration
    - Microsoft.Dynamics.Nav.Client.PageReady
    - Microsoft.Dynamics.Nav.Client.PowerBIManagement
    - Microsoft.Dynamics.Nav.Client.RoleCenterSelector
    - Microsoft.Dynamics.Nav.Client.SocialListening
    - Microsoft.Dynamics.Nav.Client.SatisficationSurvey
    - Microsoft.Dynamics.Nav.Client.TimelineVisualization
    - Microsoft.Dynamics.Nav.Client.VideoPlayer
    - Microsoft.Dynamics.Nav.Client.WebPageViewer
    - Microsoft.Dynamics.Nav.Client.WelcomeWizard

    To upgrade the control add-ons, do the following steps:

    1. Open the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] client.
    2. Search for and open the **Control Add-ins** page.
    3. Choose **Actions** > **Control Add-in Resource** > **Import**.
    4. Locate and select the .zip file for the control add-in and choose **Open**.

        The .zip files are located in the **Add-ins** folder of the [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] installation. There's a subfolder for each add-in. For example, the path to the Business Chart control add-in is `C:\Program Files\Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central\150\Service\Add-ins\BusinessChart\Microsoft.Dynamics.Nav.Client.BusinessChart.zip`.
    5. After you've imported all the new control add-in versions, restart Business Central Server instance.
2. Enable task scheduler on the server instance.
3. (Multitenant only) For tenants other than the tenant that you use for administration purposes, if you mounted the tenants using the `-AllowAppDatabaseWrite` parameter, dismount the tenants, then mount them again without using the `-AllowAppDatabaseWrite` parameter.
4. If you want to use data encryption as before, enable it.

   For more information, see [Managing Encryption and Encryption Keys](how-to-export-and-import-encryption-keys.md#encryption).

   Optionally, if you exported the encryption key instead of disabling encryption earlier, import the encryption key file to enable encryption.
