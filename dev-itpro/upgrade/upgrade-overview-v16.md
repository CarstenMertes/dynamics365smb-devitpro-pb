[!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] 2020 release wave 1 (version 16) is the second major release that is fully AL-based. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] 2019 release wave 2 (version 15) marked the release in which C/AL was replaced by AL. The classic development environment, known as C/SIDE, has been deprecated. From an application perspective, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] is now extension-based only. The [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] base application is delivered as an AL extension. Also, application functionality that isn't related to the business logic has been moved into separate modules. These modules are combined into an extension known as the System Application. This change will influence how you do the upgrade compared to earlier releases.

## Upgrade path

Depending on your current version, a direct upgrade to version 16 isn't always possible. You may have to first upgrade to an intermediate version. The following table describes the upgrade paths for supported versions:

|  Source version  |  Path  |Comment|
|------------|--------------|---|
|<ul><li> [!INCLUDE[navcrete](../developer/includes/navcrete_md.md)] (version 8)</li><li>[!INCLUDE[navcorfu](../developer/includes/navcorfu_md.md)] (version 9)</li><li>[!INCLUDE[nav2017](../developer/includes/nav2017.md)] (version 10)</li><li>[!INCLUDE[nav2018_md](../developer/includes/nav2018_md.md)] (version 11)</li><li>[!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] October 2018 (version 13)</li></ul>|<ol><li>[!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] Spring 2019 (version 14)</li><li>[!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] 2020 Release Wave 2 (version 16)</li></ol>|This path requires you convert your application from C/AL to AL.|
|<ul><li> [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] Spring 2019 (version 14)</li><li> [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] 2019 Release Wave 2 (version 15)</li></ul>|Direct to version 16|

Your current version doesn't have to be the latest update for the version. However, for intermediate versions, use to the latest available update.


## <a name="upgradepath"></a>Upgrade overview

When upgrading your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] Spring 2019 (version 14) solution to version 16, the goal is to move towards a full uptake of the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] base and system applications, as they are, and migrating code customizations to addon extensions. There are different upgrade levels that you follow to get to this state, as illustrated in the following figure. We recommend that you refactor to the system application as a minimum.

### Technical Upgrade

Although it's recommend to refactor to the system application as a minimum, you can do a technical upgrade only. A technical upgrade changes the database so that it works on the latest Business Central platform. The conversion updates the system tables of the old database to the new schema (data structure). It provides you with the latest platform features and performance enhancements.

When upgrading from version 14, part of the technical upgrade process includes converting your customized base application from C/AL to AL.

<!--
## Component Overview

### <a name="BaseApplication"></a>Base Application

The base application contains the objects (such as table, pages, codeunits, and reports) that define the business logic and functionality of the solution. In version 14 and earlier, the base application also contained system objects that were not specifically related to the business logic. In version 15, the standard business objects are now included in the Microsoft Base Application extension, and the system objects have been moved to the System Application extension. 

### <a name="SystemApplication"></a>System Application

In version 15.0, application functionality that isn't related to the business logic has been moved into separate modules that are combined into an extension known as the System Application. For an introduction to the System Application, see For more information, see [Overview of the System Application](../developer/devenv-system-application-overview.md).

### <a name="Symbols"></a>Symbols

Symbols are the application programming interface between AL code and C/AL code. Symbols enable the ability to reference C/AL objects from AL objects. Symbols are provided as an extension package, and are published to the server instance similar to application extensions, but not installed on tenants.

In version 14.0, with the base application being C/AL, there are three types of symbols: system, application, and test. System symbols contained references to the platform system objects. The application symbols contained references to the business application objects. The test symbols contained references to the test libraries used by Microsoft extensions.

In version 15, with the move to AL, the only symbols required are the system systems, which are still provided on the version 15.0 installation media (DVD).

### Customization extensions
Customization extensions are AL extensions that add functionality to the base application or system application. These extensions can be Microsoft (1st party) or 3rd party extensions. 3rd party extensions are extensions that your organization provides or extensions that are provided by others, such as from ISVs or from App Source.

## New and changed features

There are several new and changed platform and application features available in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] 2020 release wave 1. These changes affect users, administrators, and developers. For an overview of these features, see [Overview of Dynamics 365 Business Central 2020 release wave 1](/dynamics365-release-plan/2020wave1/dynamics365-business-central/).

To take advantage of these features, you'll have to do an application code upgrade, not just a technical (platform) upgrade. 

## Deprecated features

Before you upgrade, review the following articles to get an overview of features deprecated in this release:

- [Deprecated Tables](./deprecated-tables.md)

- [Deprecated Features in W1](./deprecated-features-w1.md)

  From this article, use the links in the table of content to view deprecated features specific to local versions

## Migrating from on-premises to online
