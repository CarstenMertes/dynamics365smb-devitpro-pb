# Resolving page 9624 compilation error 
This article explains how to resolve the compilation error that you get for page **9624 Finish Design List Part** when converting a [!INCLUDE[nav2018_md](../developer/includes/nav2018_md.md)] database to  [!INCLUDE[prodhort](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)].

In Business Central, page 9624 is no longer used or referenced. It's source table repurposed for other features, it isn't recommended to use it as a source table for other purposes.

## Resolution

To resolve the compilation errors, you replace page 9624 in the converted database with an empty page object as shown in the following code. 

```
OBJECT Page 9624 Finish Design List Part
{
  OBJECT-PROPERTIES
  {
    Date=;
    Time=;
    Version List=;
  }
  PROPERTIES
  {
  }
  CONTROLS
  {
  }
  CODE
  {

    BEGIN
    END.
  }
}
```

For example:

1. Copy the code to a text editor, and save it as a .txt file type.
2. Use the Microsoft Dynamics NAV Development Environment to import the file and compile the object, which replaces the existing page.
