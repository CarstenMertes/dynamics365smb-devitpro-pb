# Deprecated features in the Italian version of [!INCLUDE [prod_long](../developer/includes/prod_long.md)]
This article lists and describes the local functionality for Italy that has been removed from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)], made available from a new page or report, or replaced by a new feature.

## Report trade with customers and vendors in blocked countries/regions
You must submit a periodic report of transactions with customers and vendors in certain countries/regions that the Italian government has identified in a block list.

|Moved, Removed, or Replaced?|Why?|
|----|----|
|Removed| The functionality for blocked countries/regions has been removed from the Italian version.|

## Multiple interest rates
When you create finance charge terms and reminder terms, for delayed payment penalty, you can specify multiple interest rates so that the penalty fee is calculated from different interest rates in different periods.

|Moved, Removed, or Replaced?|Why?|
|----|----|
|Moved| The Multiple Interest Rates feature is no longer specific to Italy, so we have made it generally available in the standard product. |
