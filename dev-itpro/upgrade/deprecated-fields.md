# Deprecated Fields, and Fields Marked as Obsolete

In the latest version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)], a number of fields have been deprecated in the current release or marked to be obsolete in a later release.  

## Definitions

Deprecated fields fall into one of the following groups:

1. Fields moved to an extension by Microsoft  

   Partner impact: Remember to install the extension when you upgrade an existing solution from an earlier version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)].  
  
   Specifically for the extensions that are required for connecting on-premises solutions with [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] online for intelligent insights, you must install the **Intelligent Cloud Base Extension** extension first, and then the product-specific extension or extensions.  
2. Fields marked as **Obsolete:Pending**  

   Partner impact: None in the current release, this is just a heads-up that a change is coming.  
3. Fields no longer in use in Microsoft code  

   Partner impact: Refactor your code as soon as possible.  

## Fields marked as ObsoleteState:Pending in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)]

A number of fields are marked as ObsoleteState:Pending. There is no impact on code in this release.
