# Deprecated Features in the Swedish Version of [!INCLUDE [prod_long](../developer/includes/prod_long.md)]

This topic lists and describes the local functionality for Sweden that has been removed from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)], made available from a new page or report, or replaced by a new feature.

## Multiple Interest Rates

When you create finance charge terms and reminder terms, for delayed payment penalty, you can specify multiple interest rates so that the penalty fee is calculated from different interest rates in different periods.

|Moved, Removed, or Replaced?|Why?|
|----|----|
|Moved| The Multiple Interest Rates feature is no longer specific to Sweden, so we have made it generally available in the standard product. |
