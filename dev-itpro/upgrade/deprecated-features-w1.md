# Deprecated Features in the Base App

This article describes the features that have been moved, removed, or replaced in the W1 version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)].  

[!INCLUDE [feature-deprecation](../includes/feature-deprecation.md)]

## Changes in 2022 release wave 2

### Permissions and Permission Set Objects

|Moved, Removed, or Replaced? |    Why?|
|-----------------------------|-----|
|Replaced | In the latest enhancements to composing permissions, the following legacy objects are marked as `obsolete:pending` and replaced with new ones:<br><br>* The Log Table Permissions code unit is replaced by the Log Table Data Permissions codeunit.<br><br>* The Permissions page is replaced by the Expanded Permissions page.<br><br>* The Tenant Permissions page is replaced by the Permission Set page.<br><br>For information about other objects and methods that are being obsoleted, refer to the obsolete reasons in permission management.|

### Microsoft SharePoint Connection Setup

|Moved, Removed, or Replaced? |    Why?|
|-----------------------------|-----|
|Replaced | The SharePoint connection setup feature used for OneDrive integration is obsolete and will be removed in 2023 release wave 2 (version 23). In its place, version 21 offers a new guided setup to configure OneDrive integration for system and application features. Learn more about the new setup at [Managing OneDrive Integration with Business Central](/dynamics365/business-central/admin-onedrive-integration).<br><br>The deprecation means that the  **Microsoft SharePoint Connection Setup** page (9551 Document Service Config) is marked as `obsolete:pending`. However, the platform APIs (in codeunit 9510 Document Service Management) and the document service table that make the legacy functionality possible aren't being deprecated. So any partner solutions that use the APIs directly are unaffected by this change.<br><br>Existing customers who are upgrading to version 21, and eventually version 22, can continue to use the legacy SharePoint/Onedrive integration. But we highly recommend that you transition them to the newer OneDrive integration because it's the path going forward. Switching to the newer OneDrive integration setup is a one-way operation, meaning you can't revert to the legacy setup after you've made the switch.<br><br> We aspire to resume work on SharePoint integration at a later date.|

## Changes in 2022 release wave 1

The following feature is marked as `obsolete:pending` in 2022 release wave 1.

### XBRL reporting

|Moved, Removed, or Replaced? |    Why?|
|-----------------------------|-----|
|Removed | Over the years, XBRL has become more than just tagging your financial statement. It's seen improvements in the level of reporting detail, schemas are more flexible in their design, and ESAF has added customization capabilities. This development has meant that the XBRL implementations in the countries we support are diverse, and often complex. For example, taxonomies with hundreds of schema and linkbase files have become the norm. This complexity has made XBRL reporting a task that is better managed by either dedicated software or by service providers. <br><br> We recommend that you use these service providers. Alternatively, if you have the resources in-house, acquire a dedicated XBRL reporting tool. The XBRL org provides a list of tools and services. For more information, see [Tools and Services](https://www.xbrl.org/the-standard/how/tools-and-services/).<br><br> Currently, we expect to fully remove support for XBRL in 2023 release wave 1.|

### Intercompany Setup page

|Moved, Removed, or Replaced? |    Why?|
|-----------------------------|-----|
|Replaced | We have consolidated settings for setting up intercompany capabilities on a single page, and have added a new feature for automatically accepting intercompany transactions in general journals. The current **Intercompany Setup** page (page 621) is replaced with a new **Intercompany Setup** page (page 653). |

### Bank Reconciliation Worksheet and Deposits in North American versions (US, CA, MX)

|Moved, Removed, or Replaced? |    Why?|
|-----------------------------|-----|
|Replaced | We're standardizing the features for reconciling bank accounts and making cash deposits, so that more country versions can benefit from them. For more information, see [Standardizing the bank reconciliation process in North American versions](/dynamics365-release-plan/2022wave1/smb/dynamics365-business-central/standardizing-bank-reconciliation-process-north-american-versions). The current features will still allow you to view posted bank reconciliations done through the Bank Rec. Worksheet page, and posted deposits done through the Deposits features, but you can't use these features to create new entries. In April 2023, you must use the Bank Reconciliation page for bank reconciliations. The Bank Rec. Worksheet page won't be available.|

## Changes in 2021 release wave 2

### Standard APIs, Beta version

The following feature will be **Removed** with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] 2021 release wave 2.

|Moved, Removed, or Replaced? |    Why?|
|-----------------------------|-----|
|Removed | Beta version of the standard APIs is removed in 2021 release wave 2. At this point, Beta APIs won't be available in new releases of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)]. There are many improvements to v1.0 and v2.0 of the standard APIs. Improvements include more APIs, better performance and improved OData capabilities. It's recommended that integrations move to v2.0 of the standard APIs.|

### Client secret authentication in integrations between Microsoft-hosted Business Central online and Microsoft Dataverse

The following feature will be **Removed** with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] 2021 release wave 2.

|Moved, Removed, or Replaced? |Why?|
|---------|---------|
|Removed | The ability to use client secret Service-to-Service authentication to connect [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] with Dataverse will be removed for online tenants hosted by Microsoft in March 2022. To further strengthen security, we introduced the ability to use certificate-based authentication in client secret Service-to-Service authentication 2021 release wave 1 (version 18 and later). Existing users can easily switch to certificate-based authentication. For more information, see [Upgrade Connections from Business Central Online to Use Certificate-Based Authentication](/dynamics365-release-plan/2021wave1/smb/dynamics365-business-central/upgrade-certificate-based-service-to-service-authentication-dataverse-dynamics-365-integration). On-premises customers, and online tenants that are hosted by ISVs, can continue using client secret authentication for their connections to Dataverse.|

### Legacy Outlook add-in for synchronizing data

The legacy Outlook add-in for synchronizing data, such as to-dos, contacts, and tasks, between Business Central and Outlook is **Removed** in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] 2021 release wave 2.

|Moved, Removed, or Replaced? |Why?|
|---------|---------|
|Removed | This add-in used Business Central web services based on outdated technology.|

> [!NOTE]
> The feature is separate from and has no effect on the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] add-in for Outlook, which is described at [Using Business Central as your Business Inbox in Outlook](/dynamics365/business-central/work-outlook-addin).

## Deprecated Features in 2020 release wave 1
The following feature was marked as `obsolete:pending` in 2020 release wave 1.

### Best Price Calculations
When you have recorded special prices and line discounts for sales and purchases, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] ensures that your profit on item trade is always optimal. [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] calculates the best price on sales and purchase documents and on job and item journal lines.

|Moved, Removed, or Replaced?|Why?|
|----|----|
|Replaced|The functionality is replaced with new calculations that you can extend to include other sources or calculation methods. The current capabilities will be available, and can be used in parallel with the new, until 2021 release wave 1. For more information, see [Extending Best Price Calculations](../developer/devenv-extending-best-price-calculations.md).|

## Deprecated Features in 2019 release wave 2
The following sections describe the features that were deprecated in 2019 release wave 2.

### The Bank Data Conversion Service
You can use AMC's bank data conversion service to convert bank data from an XML file that you export from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] into a format that your bank can accept.

|Moved, Removed, or Replaced?|Why?|
|----|----|
|Moved|The functionality has been moved to an extension. It now ships as the AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension, which can convert bank data to formats that are used by more than 600 banks worldwide. For more information, see [Using the AMC Banking 365 Fundamentals extension](/dynamics365/business-central/ui-extensions-amc-banking).|

### Reports 204-207
You can generate external-facing documents, such as sales invoices and order confirmations, that you send to customers as PDF files.

The reports in the 204-207 range are replaced by the following updated reports in the 1304 to 1307 range:

- 204, Sales-Quote -> 1304, Standard Sales-Quote
- 205, Order-Confirmation -> 1305, Standard Sales-Order Conf.
- 206, Sales-Invoice -> 1306, Standard Sales-Invoice
- 207, Credit-Memo -> 1307, Standard Sales-Credit Memo

> [!NOTE]
> The **No. of Copies** field is removed from the new reports because of performance reasons and because selection of the quantity to print works differently on modern printers. To print a report more than once, users can list the same report multiple times on the **Report Selection** page for the document type in question.

|Moved, Removed, or Replaced? |Why?|
|---------|---------|
|Replaced|The reports in the 204-207 range are replaced by the reports in the 1304 to 1307 range. To avoid duplicated features, the reports in the 204-207 range will be removed.|
<!--This is just stubbed in. Need the actual names of the reports and a better description of the information they provided.-->

### User Personalizations and Profile Configurations
You can personalize pages and configure profiles by adding or removing fields, and [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] will save your changes.

|Moved, Removed, or Replaced? |Why?|
|---------|---------|
|Replaced|The shift to AL made the legacy features for personalization and configuring profiles outdated. Therefore, we've introduced new tooling. In this release, existing personalizations and configurations are discarded, and you must use the new tools to recreate them. Your new changes will be kept in future releases.|

## Objects that have been marked as obsolete
Part of deprecating features is marking the objects that comprise them as "obsolete." Before we deprecate an object, we tag it as "obsolete:pending" to alert our partners of it's deprecation. The object will have the tag for one year before we remove it from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)].
<!--should probably mention the other tags too. For example, "after one year we will mark the object as "ObsoleteState:Removed."-->

## Breaking Changes
When we move, remove, or replace an object, breaking changes can occur in other apps or extensions that use the object. To help our partners identify and resolve breaking changes, we have created a [Breaking Changes](https://github.com/microsoft/ALAppExtensions/blob/master/BREAKINGCHANGES.md) document. The document lists known issues and suggestions for what to do about them.

## Features that are available only in the online version
<!--Should we include a section about this?-->
Some features are available only under specific circumstances, or not at all intended for use in on-premises versions of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)]. For a list and descriptions of those features, see [Features not implemented in on-premises deployments](../features-not-implemented-on-premises.md).
