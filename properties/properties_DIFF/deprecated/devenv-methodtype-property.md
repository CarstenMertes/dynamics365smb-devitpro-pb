# MethodType Property

[!INCLUDE[cal_only](../includes/cal_only.md)]

Sets a date or totals type method on the query column. The method is applied by the [Method Property](devenv-method-property.md).  

  
## Applies to  
 Query columns  
  
## Property Value  
  
|Value|Description|  
|-----------|-----------------|  
|None|No method type is applied. This is the default value.|  
|Date|Applies the date method that is specified by the **Method** property to the query column. The available date methods retrieve the day, month, or year from the date expression of field values in the column.|  
|Totals|Applies the totals method that is specified by the **Method** property to the query column. The available totals methods calculate the sum of field values in the column, the average, minimum, and maximum field value in a column, or the total number, or count, of records for a group in the resulting dataset.|  
  
## Remarks  
The **Date** method type can only be set in fields that have a data type of Date or DateTime. <!-- For more information about date methods, see [Using the Date Method to Retrieve Day, Month, and Year Data](../devenv-Using-the-Date-Method-to-Retrieve-Day-Month-and-Year-Data.md).  -->
  
Except when the **Method** property is set to **Count**, the **Totals** method type can only be used on fields that have a numeric data type of **Decimal**, **Integer**, **BigInteger**, or **Duration**.  
  
When you set the **MethodType** property of a column to **Totals**, the rows in the resulting dataset are automatically grouped by the other columns in the query as indicated by a check mark in the **Group By** column in Query Designer. When grouped in the resulting dataset, rows that have similar column values are combined into a single record. Setting the **MethodType** property to **Totals** corresponds to using the SQL aggregate functions SUM,AVG, MIN, MAX, and COUNT in SQL SELECT statements.
