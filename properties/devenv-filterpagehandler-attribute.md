# FilterPageHandler Attribute

Specifies that the method is a FilterPageHandler method.

## Applies to  

AL test methods on test codeunits. A test method is a method that has the [Test Attribute](devenv-test-attribute.md) declared. 

## Syntax  
  
```AL
[FilterPageHandler]
FilterPageHandler(var RecRef: RecordRef) : Boolean;
```    

## Remarks

The **FilterPageHandler** method is called when a filter page is invoked in the code. It tests the UI that is generated by a **FilterPageBuilder** data type. 

The **FilterPageHandler** attribute requires that the method where it is applied has the signature `FilterPageHandler(var RecRef: RecordRef) : Boolean;`. The parameter variable, *RecRef*, holds the record of the filter page.
