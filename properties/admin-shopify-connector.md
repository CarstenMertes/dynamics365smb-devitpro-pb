# Training Scenarios for Integrating with Shopify

This section demonstrates common scenarios and walks you through the steps to test or train the users on the workflow of the integrated [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] and the Shopify store.

## Preparation

You have the following two options for creating a Shopify account:

- Trial
- Development stores, if you do recurring demos and trainings

### [Trial](#tab/trial)

Begin by creating an Azure Active Directory tenant and get the administration login and password. For more information, see [Preparing demonstrations of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)]](demo-environment.md), steps 1-6. You can stop once you get the administrator account that you got as part of your demo account, typically equivalent to *admin @ CRMbc123456.onmicrosoft.com*.

Navigate to [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com) and use this administrator account to sign up for a free 14-day trial. For more information on how to create and personalize your online store, see [Shopify Help Center](https://help.shopify.com/).

In the **Shopify Admin** of the created shop, apply following **Settings**:

* Deactivate **Automatically archive the order** in the **Order Processing** section of the [**Checkout**](https://www.shopify.com/admin/settings/checkout) settings in your **Shopify admin**.
* Consider enabling the *Show login link in storefront and checkout* in the **Customer account settings** section of the checkout settings.
* Consider selecting the *Company name - Optional* option in the **Customer information** section of the checkout settings.
* Enable the **Show tipping options at checkout** option in the **Tipping** section of the checkout settings, if you plan to demonstrate tipping.
* Activate test payments. You have two options. Start by navigating to [**Payments**](https://www.shopify.com/admin/settings/payments) settings:  
  1. *(for testing) Bogus Gateway*. For more information, see [Activate Bogus Gateway for testing](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/checkout-settings/test-orders#place-a-test-order-by-simulating-a-transaction).
  2. *Shopify payments* in test mode. For more information, see [Testing Shopify Payments](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/payments/shopify-payments/testing-shopify-payments).

* Select plan in the [**Plan**](https://www.shopify.com/admin/settings/plan) settings to be able test checkout process.

> [!Important]  
> To avoid payments, remember to cancel your Shopify trial.

Install the **Dynamics 365 Business Central** app in your Shopify online store.

1. Locate the [Dynamics 365 Business Central](https://apps.shopify.com/dynamics-365-business-central) app on the [Shopify AppStore](https://apps.shopify.com/).
2. Choose the **Add App** button, and then sign in into your Shopify account if prompted.
3. Review privacy and permissions, and then choose the **Install App** button. You can find and open the installed **Dynamics 365 Business Central** app in the Apps section on the sidebar of **Shopify admin**.
4. Choose **Sign up now** to start the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] trial, and then use the administrator account.

### [Development store](#tab/dev-store)

Begin by joining the [Shopify Partner Program](https://help.shopify.com/partners/about).
Once it's completed, you can use **Partner Dashboard** to create the development store. For more information, see [Creating development stores](https://help.shopify.com/partners/dashboard/managing-stores/development-stores).

After creation of the store, in the **Shopify Admin** of the created shop, apply following **Settings**:

* Deactivate **Automatically archive the order** in the **Order Processing** section of the [**Checkout**](https://www.shopify.com/admin/settings/checkout) settings in your **Shopify admin**.
* Consider enabling the *Show login link in storefront and checkout* in the **Customer account settings** section of the checkout settings.
* Consider selecting the *Company name - Optional* option in the **Customer information** section of the checkout settings.
* Enable the **Show tipping options at checkout** option in the **Tipping** section of the checkout settings, if you plan to demonstrate tipping.
* Activate test payments. You have two options. Start by navigating to [**Payments**](https://www.shopify.com/admin/settings/payments) settings:  
  1. *(for testing) Bogus Gateway*. For more information, see [Activate Bogus Gateway for testing](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/checkout-settings/test-orders#place-a-test-order-by-simulating-a-transaction).
  2. *Shopify payments* in test mode. For more information, see [Testing Shopify Payments](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/payments/shopify-payments/testing-shopify-payments).

As a partner, you probably already have a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] account for demos. If not, you should create one. For more information, see [Preparing demonstrations of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)]](demo-environment.md).
