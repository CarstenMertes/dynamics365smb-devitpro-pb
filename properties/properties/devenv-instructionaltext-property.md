# InstructionalText Property

Sets the text used for instructions in the UI.  
  
## Applies to  
  
- Page object  
- RequestPage
- PageGroup

## Parameters

*Locked*  
&emsp;Type: [Boolean](../methods-auto/boolean/boolean-data-type.md)  
If `true` the InstructionalText is locked and should not be translated.  

*Comment*  
&emsp;Type: [Text](../methods-auto/text/text-data-type.md)  
Descriptive text for the InstructionalText, for example, with regards to translation.

*MaxLength*  
&emsp;Type: [Integer](../methods-auto/integer/integer-data-type.md)  
Sets the maximum length of the specific InstructionalText.

## Remarks

The default is an empty string, which means there will be no instructions. According to the user assistance model for [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../includes/prodshort.md)], apps are expected to apply instructional text to setup guides and similar pages.  

The following example illustrates how you can apply instructional text in an app:  

```AL
InstructionalText = 'Add an entity from your list of contacts. The entity can be a person or a company.';
```
