# WordLayout Property

Sets the imported file name and the Word layout that is used on a report.

> [!NOTE]  
> Reports support both Word and RDL layout.

## Remarks

The  Word file has to be in the same folder as the AL object. 

## Example
<!--
Code taken from this file: devenv-howto-report-layout
-->
The following example shows how to use this property to generate the *MyWordReport.docx* file.

```AL
pageextension 50100 MyExtension extends "Customer List"
{
    trigger OnOpenPage();
    begin
        report.Run(Report::MyWordReport);
    end;
}

report 50124 MyWordReport
{
    DefaultLayout = Word;
    WordLayout = 'MyWordReport.docx';
}
```
