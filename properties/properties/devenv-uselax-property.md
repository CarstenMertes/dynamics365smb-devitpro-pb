# UseLax Property

Specifies whether an XMLport uses LAX \(Lazy API for XML\) to process an XML file.  
  
## Applies to  
 
- XMLports  
  
## Property Value

**true** if the XMLport uses LAX; otherwise **false**.  

## Syntax

```AL
UseLax = true;
```
  
## Remarks

Extra elements and attributes are often added to XML documents when they're processed in software systems. If this property is set to **Yes**, the XML document will validate as long as the document meets the minimum schema definition. When extra elements and attributes are included in a namespace, the XML document will successfully validate against the schema. A validation error will occur, if not. For more information about namespaces, see [Using Namespaces with XMLports](../devenv-using-namespaces-with-xmlports.md).
