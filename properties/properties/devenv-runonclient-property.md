# RunOnClient Property

Sets whether a .NET object that is defined by a variable is run on the [!INCLUDE[webclient](../includes/webclient.md)] or [!INCLUDE[d365fin_server_md](../includes/d365fin_server_md.md)].  

## Applies to  

Variables of the **DotNet** data type.  

## Syntax 

```AL
 [RunOnClient]
 Camera: DotNet UT_CameraProvider;
``` 

## Remarks  

The **RunOnClient** property is used alongside safe listed APIs that provide access to client-side device capabilities, such as camera or location.

The **RunOnClient** property is part of .NET interoperability in [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long_md](../includes/d365fin_long_md.md)] that you can use to expand your solution using .NET assemblies. With .NET interoperability, you can call methods and properties in a class of a .NET assembly from AL code by defining a variable for the class. When you set the **RunOnClient** property on a variable, then the class instance that is defined by the variable is instantiated on the [!INCLUDE[webclient](../includes/webclient.md)].
