Sets a list of FlowFields to automatically calculate.  
  
## Applies to  
  
-   Reports  
-   Table elements in XMLports

## Syntax

<!--
Notes from meeting: 
The list of FlowFields, what you describe here is just a list of fields that are CalcFields that you want to have calculated if you have [AutoCalcField property](devenv-autocalcfield-property.md) enabled.
