# DefaultLayout Property

Specifies whether the report uses the built-in RDL or Word report layout by default.  
  
## Applies to  
  
- Reports  
  
## Property Value  
  
- **RDLC** - specifies the built-in RDL layout as the default layout.    
- **Word** - specifies the built-in Word layout as the default layout. 

## Syntax

```AL
DefaultLayout = Word;
``` 
  
## Remarks

A report object can include a built-in layout of either an RDL type, Word type, or both. When you set the property to a type, then that layout type is used by default to view, save and print a report. Users can change a report to use another layout from the [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long_md](../includes/d365fin_long_md.md)] client.
