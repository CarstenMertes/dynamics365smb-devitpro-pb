{
    views
    {
        addfirst
        {
            view(BalanceLCY)
            {
                Caption = 'Ordered Balance LCY';
                OrderBy = ascending ("Balance (LCY)");
                Filters = where ("Balance (LCY)" = filter (> 500), Name = filter ('G*'));
            }
        }
    }
