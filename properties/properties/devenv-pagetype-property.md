# PageType Property

Sets the type of page that is created. The page type defines the layout and options on the page and it is important to choose the page type that aligns with the purpose of a page. For more information about designing pages, see [Page Types and Layouts](../devenv-page-types-and-layouts.md). For more information about the page object, see [Pages Overview](../devenv-pages-overview.md).

The following page types are available:

|PageType|Description|

|`Card`|Master, reference, and set up data management.|
