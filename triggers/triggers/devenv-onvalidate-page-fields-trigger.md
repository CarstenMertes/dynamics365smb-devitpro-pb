# OnValidate (Page fields) Trigger

Runs when a field loses focus after its value has been changed.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```AL
trigger OnValidate()
begin
    ...
end;
```  
  
## Applies to  
  
- Pages  
  
## Remarks

Use this trigger to validate user entries in a page field. If validation fails, then the field is marked with an error and its value is not saved.  
  
The OnValidate trigger is also a field trigger at the table level. For more information, see [OnValidate (Fields) Trigger](devenv-onvalidate-fields-trigger.md). If both the table field and page field triggers are defined, then the OnValidate trigger on the table field is run before the OnValidate trigger on the page field.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
> You can use this trigger to write to the database.
