```AL
    trigger OnPageBackgroundTaskCompleted(TaskId: Integer; Results: Dictionary of [Text, Text])
    var
        started: Text;
        waited: Text;
        finished: Text;
        PBTNotification: Notification;
    begin
        if (TaskId = WaitTaskId) then begin
            Evaluate(started, Results.Get('started'));
            Evaluate(waited, Results.Get('waited'));
            Evaluate(finished, Results.Get('finished'));

            before1 := started;

            PBTNotification.Message('Start and finish times have been updated.');
