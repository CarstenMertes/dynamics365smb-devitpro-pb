# Boolean (Logical) Operators
Logical operators can only be used with arguments that can be evaluated to Boolean.  
  
## Boolean Operators  
 As the following table shows, the NOT operator is a unary prefix operator. This means that it takes only one argument and is placed in front of the argument. The AND, OR, and XOR operators are binary infix operators; they take two arguments and are placed between the corresponding arguments.  
  
|Operator|Name|Expression|Resulting data type|  
|--------------|----------|----------------|-------------------------|  
|NOT|Logical negation|NOT bool|bool|  
|AND|Logical and|bool AND bool|bool|  
|OR|Logical or|bool OR bool|bool|  
|XOR|Exclusive logical or|bool XOR bool|bool|
