# RoleTailored Client Design in Dynamics NAV
## Design Principle  
The RoleTailored clients have a customizable user interface that supports the job functions of different work roles in your organization. The RoleTailored clients are built around a navigation structure based on a user-centric design. The RoleTailored clients are comprised of a number of pages, similar to pages, which contain different information and tasks. The pages are combined in the RoleTailored clients and displayed in a series of windows  

In a RoleTailored client, a user starts from a single navigational window called the Role Center that displays information pertinent to their role in the company. From the Role Center, the user can navigate to additional information and open separate windows for performing tasks and viewing data. For each role that you support, you can create a Role Center that displays key information and tasks that are required by that role.
