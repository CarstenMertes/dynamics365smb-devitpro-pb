# Create an online development environment from GitHub

> *The prerequisites for this how to is that you have completed the [Use Azure KeyVault for secrets with AL-Go](algo-use-azure-keyvault-for-secrets.md) instructions.* 

To create an online development environment, we need to authenticate to our [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] Admin API using OAuth. The (Create Online Dev. Environment) workflow works unattended if you provide a secret called `AdminCenterApiCredentials`, either as a GitHub Secret or in a key vault. Currently, the Admin Center API doesn't yet support S2S, which means that the `AdminCenterApiCredentials` can't be formatted like explained in section 3, but must be formatted as: `{"refreshtoken":"refreshtoken"}`.

Getting the refresh token can be done using this command on a machine with `BcContainerHelper` installed:

```powershell
New-BcAuthContext -includeDeviceLogin | ConvertTo-GitHubGoCredentials | Set-Clipboards
```

If you do **not** provide an `AdminCenterApiCredentials` secret, the workflow initiate a device code flow and you can sign in by opening a browser, pasting in this URL `https://aka.ms/devicelogin` using this code and have the workflow continue. In order to get the code, you have to inspect the details of the workflow and open the job called Check AdminCenterApiCredentials / Initiate Device sign in (open to see code)

## Steps

1. On www.github.com, on the **Actions** tab, select the **Create Online Dev. Environment** workflow.
1. choose **Run workflow** and specify the requested environment name and whether you want to reuse the environment if it already exists and then choose the **Run workflow** button.
1. When the workflow is complete, inspect the pull request to see the changes in the `launch.json` file. This environment can now be used by a developer, but two developers can't share one online environment.
1. Merge the pull request and now you're ready to do rapid application development (RAD).


## Next step

Next, you can look into how to [Set up CI/CD for an Existing Per-Tenant Extension](algo-setup-cicd-existing-pte.md).
