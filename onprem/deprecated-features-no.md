# Deprecated Features in the Norwegian Version of Microsoft Dynamics NAV 2018
This topic lists and describes the local functionality for Norway that has been removed from [!INCLUDE[navnow](includes/navnow_md.md)], made available from a new page or report, or replaced by a new feature.

## Multiple Interest Rates
When you create finance charge terms and reminder terms, for delayed payment penalty, you can specify multiple interest rates so that the penalty fee is calculated from different interest rates in different periods.

|Moved, Removed, or Replaced?|Why?|
|----|----|
|Moved| The Multiple Interest Rates feature is no longer specific to Norway, so we have made it generally available in the standard product. |

## Paper Sources and Tray Numbers
When printing Norwegian sales documents, you can set up different tray numbers and paper sources on the first, last, and other pages.

|Moved, Removed, or Replaced?|Why?|
|----|----|
|Removed| The feature is not used. |
