# Create a release of your application

> *The prerequisite for this how to is that you have completed the [Register a customer sandbox environment for Continuous Deployment using Service-to-Service Authentication](algo-create-release-app.md) instructions.*

## Steps

1. On www.github.com, in your project, go to the **Actions** tab and in the left pane, select **Create Release**. 
1. Choose **Run workflow**, and in the dialog enter `1.0` as name and tag of the release, and then choose **Run workflow**.
1. When the create release workflow completes, choose the **< > Code** tab to see the releases.
1. Choose the release (1.0).  
The release notes are pulled from all pull requests checked in since the last release. The autogenerated release note also contains a list of the new contributors and a link to the full changelog. 
1. Choose the **Edit** button icon (the pencil) to modify the release notes.  
At the bottom, you can see the artifacts published, both the apps and the source code. A tag is created in the repository for the release number to always keep it.

## Next step

Now, you can move on to [Register a Customer Production Environment for Manual Deployment](algo-register-cust-prod-env.md).
