# Analyzing Field Monitoring Telemetry

[!INCLUDE[2020_releasewave1.md](../includes/2020_releasewave2.md)]

Keeping sensitive data secure and private is a core concern for most businesses. To add a layer of security, you can monitor important fields when someone changes a value. For example, you might want to be notified if someone changes your company's IBAN number. Both the addition of a field to be monitored and actual changes to a monitored field will be logged to telemetry.

To gather this data, field monitoring must be enabled. For more information, see [Auditing Changes in Business Central - Monitoring Sensitive Fields](/dynamics365/business-central/across-log-changes#monitoring-sensitive-fields) in the Application help.

## Sensitive field monitor status changed

Occurs when the field monitor feature is started or stopped in the company.

|severityLevel|**1**|

### Custom dimensions

<!--
The custom dimensions that are of particular interest for this operation include: numberOfRows, result, serverExecutionTime, sqlExecutes, sqlRowsRead, totalTime. For a description of these dimensions and other custom dimensions, see [Custom dimensions](#customdimensions).

<!--
|Dimension|Description or value|
|---------|-----|
|numberOfRows|Specifies the number of rows generated for the report dataset.|
|result|**Success**.|
|serverExecutionTime|Specifies the amount of time it took the service to complete the request. The time has the format hh:mm:ss.sssssss.|
|sqlExecutes|Specifies the number of SQL statements that the report executed. |
|totalTime|Specifies the amount of time it took for the system to generate the dataset and render the report. The time has the format hh:mm:ss.sssssss.|
