# Align Table Definition

For cloud migration to succeed, the on-premises tables object and their online counterparts must have the same definitions for the following properties: 

- Primary keys
- Field names and data types

Other properties of tables aren't required to match or the difference can be handled by cloud migration.

- Different table names

  If the on-premises and online tables have different names, you can use table mapping during the cloud migration to handle this discrepancy. 
- Different table IDs
  
  Table IDs aren't used in SQL databases, so the IDs are ignored in cloud migration.

- Secondary keys

  Secondary keys are ignored in cloud migration.
